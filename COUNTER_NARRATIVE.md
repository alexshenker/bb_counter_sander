## A Thirteen-Year Employee and the Challenge of Sustained Performance

Aleksandr Akulov joined Bloomberg LP on June 11, 2012. Over the course of his tenure, he built meaningful client relationships in the ETS-Listed AMER South group, where he covered institutional clients, managed a portfolio of accounts, and was measured -- like every member of his team -- on revenue generation, client activity, strategic product adoptions, pipeline development, and campaign engagement. For many years, he performed well. His manager acknowledged as much in the 2025 year-end evaluation when he wrote: "Alex historically has proven that he has the skill set to be successful in the group." That sentence was not a concession. It was the foundation of the evaluation's message: the company believed in Aleksandr, believed he could do this job, and wanted him to get back to the standard he had previously demonstrated.

Bloomberg LP is a company that invests in its employees. It paid for Aleksandr's MBA/JD degree. It provides one of the most generous parental leave policies in the financial services industry: six months of fully paid leave for a primary caregiver, available equally to fathers and mothers regardless of gender. When Aleksandr took his first parental leave from approximately November 2023 to May 2024, and his second from July 12, 2025 to December 28, 2025, Bloomberg honored that policy completely. He received his full salary for both leave periods. His position was held for him. He returned each time to his role, his title, and his team.

This case is not about parental leave, and it is not about national origin. Aleksandr took leave. Bloomberg paid him. He came back. What happened between those events was a performance conversation -- the kind that happens to employees every year across every team in the company. The plaintiff asks you to believe that an honest performance assessment is retaliation, and that informal workplace greetings constitute ethnic discrimination. The evidence shows otherwise on both counts.

## The Performance Concerns Were Real and Pre-Dated the Second Leave

Before Aleksandr left for his second parental leave on July 12, 2025, his manager conducted a standard mid-year evaluation covering January through July of that year. That evaluation identified specific, measurable shortfalls that had nothing to do with parental leave and everything to do with how Aleksandr was working when he was on the job.

The mid-year evaluation found that Aleksandr had booked only one GDSF forecast during the first half of 2025 -- a single deal at Leverage Shares totaling $26,300. By the midpoint of the year, that was his entire bookable revenue production. He had three credited strategic campaign adoptions, but those three users had each tried the relevant workflows exactly once and had not actually incorporated them into their processes. His manager rated these adoptions as "generous" credits because the behavior they were intended to drive never materialized.

Most significantly, the manager identified a pattern of insufficient client engagement that had been flagged in prior evaluation periods. Aleksandr's primary coverage was in Connecticut, one of the densest financial services corridors in the country. Yet in the first half of 2025, he made only 11 client-visit days in Connecticut, conducting 45 in-person meetings across just 18 accounts. For an outside sales role where coverage breadth and face-time frequency are core competencies, these numbers reflected inadequate effort. His days on the road typically began around 10:00 AM and ended before the market close, cutting short the window for client engagement. The manager had raised this exact concern -- the need for more complete days and a broader range of client visits -- in the prior year's evaluation. Aleksandr had not made the changes.

These are not manufactured criticisms assembled after the fact. They are documented, specific, measurable performance observations recorded in Bloomberg's evaluation system before the second leave began. The mid-year evaluation was written before Aleksandr went on leave. It assessed performance during a period when he was working full-time, compared against peers who were also working full-time over the same January-to-July window. The leave did not cause these shortfalls. The shortfalls existed while Aleksandr was present, active, and working every day.

---

## The Year-End Evaluation Was the Only Honest Option

When it came time to write the 2025 year-end evaluation, the manager faced a straightforward practical reality: the only period during which Aleksandr worked and could be evaluated against his peers was the first half of the year. He was on approved parental leave for the entire second half. The alternative to evaluating his first-half performance was to not evaluate him at all -- to simply skip the assessment, give him a pass, and pretend the year had not happened. That would have been a disservice to Aleksandr, to his peers, and to the integrity of the evaluation process.

The year-end evaluation stated plainly what had happened: "Alex spent the majority of the second half of 2025 on paternity leave (7/11/25-12/28/25), as a result we were only able to evaluate his performance relative to his peers at the midyear." This was context, not causation. The manager was explaining why the evaluation was based on the data it was based on. He was not penalizing Aleksandr for being on leave. He was explaining that the available performance data came from the period when Aleksandr was working -- the same period covered in the mid-year evaluation, the same period when every member of the team was present and could be compared fairly.

The plaintiff's legal team argues that the year-end evaluation compared Aleksandr's half-year output against peers who had a full year. That mischaracterizes what the evaluation says. The evaluation explicitly states it assessed performance "at the midyear" -- meaning the comparison was against peers' midyear performance, not their full-year totals. Every team member was evaluated at mid-year. Aleksandr's midyear numbers lagged his peers' midyear numbers. The fact that those peers went on to produce additional results in the second half does not retroactively improve Aleksandr's first-half performance.

The plaintiff also takes issue with the evaluation mentioning parental leave at all. But not mentioning it would have been stranger. The employee was absent for six months. A year-end evaluation that assessed the full year without noting why the employee was present for only half of it would have been incomplete and potentially confusing to anyone reviewing the record. The manager included the context because it was relevant context -- not because it was the reason for the assessment.

---

## The Counter-Metrics Tell an Incomplete Story

The plaintiff will present aggregate activity numbers showing that Aleksandr had 648 client interactions (described as the highest on the team), 178 visits (described as the highest), and 177 unique firms engaged (described as the highest). These numbers, sourced from Bloomberg's standard team reporting tools, measure volume. They do not measure quality, strategic value, or outcomes.

Bloomberg does not evaluate its sales professionals solely on how many phone calls they make or how many firms they contact. It evaluates them on whether those interactions produce results: revenue bookings, sustained product adoptions, pipeline that converts to bookable forecasts, and strategic client development. By those measures -- the measures that actually drive the business -- Aleksandr's first half of 2025 was not consistent with the expectations of the role.

Consider the specifics. His 648 interactions and 177 unique firms generated limited bookable revenue at the mid-year mark. His three strategic adoptions resulted in single-use trials that were never repeated. His Connecticut coverage -- the primary territory assigned to him -- showed insufficient breadth given the density of opportunity in that corridor. High activity with low conversion is not high performance. It is an indication that something in the approach is not working, which is exactly what the evaluation identified.

The plaintiff will raise the number of GDSF forecasts in the CRM system, claiming the evaluation undercounted. Revenue forecasting in Bloomberg's system involves multiple stages, products, and qualification criteria. The evaluation's characterization of bookable forecasts reflected the methodology used consistently across the team -- distinguishing between qualified, bookable pipeline and earlier-stage entries. If any forecast was miscounted, it was an oversight in a multi-product, multi-stage pipeline, not a deliberate suppression of the plaintiff's numbers. The defense must verify the exact CRM records and be prepared to explain the counting methodology that was applied to all team members equally.

The plaintiff's prorated revenue analysis -- claiming $80,100 against a prorated half-year target of approximately $57,500, or 139% of pace -- requires additional context. The $80,100 includes $53,800 in revenue that was booked while Aleksandr was on leave, from a Two Seas deal that his pre-leave pipeline work contributed to. The company has always acknowledged that revenue, and it was credited to him in the evaluation. But at the actual mid-year mark, when Aleksandr was present and being compared against peers who were also present, his bookable revenue consisted of one deal for $26,300. The Q3 revenue represents the delayed recognition of pre-leave work -- a standard feature of the sales cycle. It does not change what the midyear snapshot showed about Aleksandr's performance relative to his peers at that point in time.

The activity metrics and the prorated revenue calculation are exactly the kind of selective framing that obscures rather than illuminates. An employee can lead the team in call volume while lagging the team in every metric that the business uses to evaluate success. The evaluation was based on the full range of performance criteria, not a subset chosen to favor a particular narrative.

## Coverage Decisions Were Business-Driven, Not Retaliatory

When an employee takes a six-month leave of absence -- for any reason -- client relationships cannot be put on hold. Clients need coverage. Markets do not pause. The team must continue to function. During Aleksandr's first leave (approximately November 2023 to May 2024), certain accounts and territories, including Houston and upstate New York coverage, were reassigned to other team members to ensure continuity of client service.

When Aleksandr returned from his first leave, a business judgment was made about how to reintegrate his coverage. Clients that had been serviced by other team members for six months had developed working relationships with their new coverage representatives. In some cases, active deals were in progress. Reverting every account to Aleksandr immediately upon his return would have disrupted those relationships and potentially cost the business revenue. Coverage reintegration after an extended absence is a management decision that balances the returning employee's portfolio needs against client continuity. It is not automatic restoration, and it is not retaliation.

This same principle applied to the redistribution of Bryan Baptist's accounts when Baptist left the company during Aleksandr's second leave. The team was managing active client relationships under reduced headcount. Coverage from Baptist's departure was distributed based on each remaining team member's existing geographic footprint, current capacity, active deal flow, and client relationships. Aleksandr was on leave and had no active client relationships during the distribution period. His manager was working with the team members who were present and actively covering clients. This was a practical staffing decision made under real-time operational pressure, not a deliberate exclusion.

Regarding the Connecticut lead that was assigned to another team member: leads are routed based on existing client relationships, deal context, and who is best positioned to convert the opportunity. A single lead assignment is a routine management decision. It does not constitute evidence of a conspiracy.

The plaintiff emphasizes the difference in coverage universe size between Aleksandr (1,138 firms) and other team members, particularly James Johnston (6,099 firms). This comparison, while numerically accurate, strips away every relevant variable other than raw count. Coverage universes are not fungible. The firms assigned to each team member differ in size, product usage, revenue potential, geographic density, and relationship maturity. Aleksandr's Connecticut territory encompasses a concentrated financial services corridor where a single account can generate significant revenue. A team member covering a geographically dispersed territory with thousands of smaller firms has a larger count but not necessarily greater revenue opportunity per assigned firm. Coverage is assigned based on product specialization, geographic alignment, client tier, historical relationship ownership, and demonstrated capacity to service accounts -- not leave duration.

The 5.4x ratio between Johnston's firm count and Aleksandr's does not account for any of these variables. It is designed to produce outrage, not understanding.

---

## James Johnston Is Not a Comparable Employee

The plaintiff frames James Johnston as a controlled comparison: same team, same manager, same role, similar tenure, but Johnston took one month of leave while Aleksandr took six months, and Johnston has 5.4x the coverage. The implication is that the only variable explaining the coverage gap is leave duration.

This comparison omits essential context. Johnston's coverage universe reflects years of client development, territory growth, and demonstrated capacity to manage a large book. If Johnston's coverage exceeded Aleksandr's before either employee took any parental leave -- and Bloomberg's historical records will show whether this is the case -- the disparity has nothing to do with leave and everything to do with the different trajectories of two careers that happen to share a team.

Additionally, Johnston's one-month leaves created minimal operational disruption. A four-week absence can be managed with temporary coverage arrangements that do not require full account reassignment. A six-month absence requires substantive redistribution. The business impact of a one-month absence and a six-month absence are genuinely, materially different, and managing those impacts differently is not evidence of discrimination -- it is evidence of responsive management. An employer is not required to pretend that one month and six months have the same operational consequences.

The plaintiff's suggestion that Johnston "knows that taking the full six months would put him in trouble" is the plaintiff's speculation about Johnston's motivations, not evidence of anything the company did.

## Revenue Targets Reflect Business Planning, Not Individual Targeting

Aleksandr's 2026 revenue target was set at $175,000, up from $115,000 in 2025 -- a 52% increase. The plaintiff frames this as a setup-to-fail: higher targets with fewer resources. The reality is that revenue targets are set through Bloomberg's standard business planning process, informed by market conditions, product line growth expectations, team capacity, and company-wide revenue goals. If other team members received comparable target increases for 2026 -- and the company's records will demonstrate whether they did -- the increase reflects organizational expectations, not individual persecution.

Revenue targets also reflect the employee's product portfolio, not just firm count. An employee with access to high-growth product lines or clients with expanding technology budgets may receive a higher target based on the revenue potential of their assigned accounts, regardless of how many firms are in the coverage universe. A single large client adopting a suite of Bloomberg products can generate more revenue than dozens of smaller accounts with limited product usage. The raw math of dividing a target by a firm count produces a misleading figure precisely because it treats all firms as equal, which they are not.

If the data shows that Aleksandr's target increase was disproportionate to his peers', that fact will need to be addressed. If it was consistent with team-wide or department-wide increases, the plaintiff's framing collapses.

## The Manager's Verbal Statements in Context

The plaintiff's case relies heavily on statements attributed to the manager, documented in the plaintiff's personal text messages to friends. These statements were not recorded. They were not made in writing. They are the plaintiff's characterization of verbal conversations, relayed to a sympathetic audience in an informal setting, and now presented as direct evidence of discriminatory intent. Several require specific attention.

**The "firing joke" (approximately July 2023):** The plaintiff claims the manager "joked" about firing him if he took the full six months of parental leave. The manager's recollection of this conversation will speak for itself. What the evidence shows is that whatever was said, the plaintiff took the full six months, was not fired, was not disciplined, returned to his full position, and received his full salary throughout the leave. If the manager made an offhand comment about the operational challenges of a six-month absence, that is a legitimate management concern, not a threat. If it was workplace humor -- common in high-pressure financial services environments -- it was in poor taste but it was not followed by any adverse action. The plaintiff took the leave. Nothing happened to him because he took the leave.

**The alleged second "firing joke" (approximately August-October 2024):** This is reported solely through the plaintiff's text to a friend. The context indicates the comment was made after the plaintiff was moved to sit near his manager as part of a team-wide seating rearrangement. The plaintiff himself described his reaction as ambivalent, noting he had a "better seat." The connection between this alleged comment and parental leave is the plaintiff's inference, not a documented fact.

**"Thought you were quitting" (February 17, 2026):** The plaintiff reports that the manager said he ranked him low because he assumed the plaintiff was going to quit during his leave. If the manager expressed concern about the employee's commitment -- which is a legitimate management concern when an employee clears personal items from his desk before a six-month absence -- that concern is separate from the evaluation itself. The evaluation was prepared and documented before the February 17 meeting. It cites specific performance metrics: revenue, adoptions, client visits, day structure. Those metrics are the basis for the rating, not the manager's concern about retention. What the manager said conversationally during the meeting does not override what the evaluation document contains.

**"We didn't cut your pay and you were away for 6 months" (February 17, 2026, evening):** The manager approached the plaintiff after the formal meeting to express support. The full statement as the plaintiff reports it is: "we like you a lot, we don't cut your pay and you were away for 6 months." This is a manager telling an employee he is valued and that the company honored its leave benefit. It is not an admission that compensation was tied to leave. Read in good faith, the statement means: "We value you. You received your full salary during leave. We believe in you." The plaintiff reads hostility into a statement of support because the plaintiff is interpreting every interaction through the lens of an anticipated legal claim.

**Manager's justification of 0% raise: "you got 16% last year so it's like 8 and 8" (March 2025):** The manager was contextualizing Aleksandr's compensation trajectory over a multi-year period. The prior year's 16% raise reflected strong performance. The current year's 0% reflected a period where the employee was present for only part of the evaluation window and performance during that period did not support an additional increase. Averaging across years is a standard way managers explain compensation decisions. It is not an admission that the current year's outcome was driven by leave.

**"Mostly cuz I took 6 months off" (February 2025, the plaintiff's characterization):** The plaintiff told his friends this was said "off the record." This is the plaintiff's paraphrase of a verbal conversation, relayed in an informal text thread. What the manager actually said, in what context, and whether the plaintiff accurately captured the substance or injected his own interpretation is unknowable from this evidence. The manager may have been explaining that the evaluation period in which the employee was on leave for half the year produced limited data to justify a raise -- a different and legitimate point.

The defense does not need to prove that every one of these statements was fabricated. It needs to show that the plaintiff's interpretation -- that each statement reveals discriminatory intent -- is not the only reasonable interpretation. In several cases, it is not even the most natural interpretation. The plaintiff is a man who decided early that his employer was retaliating against him and has filtered every subsequent interaction through that belief.

## "Comrade" Was an Informal Greeting, Not a Slur

The plaintiff has recently added a national origin discrimination claim, alleging that the manager regularly called him "Comrade" because he is Russian, and that the same manager called Indian team member Bryan Baptist "Rahul." The plaintiff frames this as evidence of pervasive national origin discrimination on top of leave retaliation.

Context matters. The ETS-Listed AMER South team operates in a fast-paced financial services sales environment where informal communication, nicknames, and casual banter are part of the daily culture. "Comrade" was used as a friendly, informal greeting -- comparable to "buddy," "chief," or "boss" -- not as an ethnic slur. Sales floors are not libraries. The level of formality the plaintiff now demands was never the standard the team operated under, and the plaintiff never objected to or expressed discomfort with the term at any point during the year-plus it was allegedly used.

That last point is important. The plaintiff claims "Comrade" was used for over a year. During that entire period, the plaintiff never asked the manager to stop. He never raised it with HR. He never filed a complaint. He never mentioned it in his WhatsApp group chat where he documented every other perceived slight. The term apparently did not bother him enough to mention to anyone -- until he began building a legal case and recognized it could be recharacterized as discrimination.

If the manager stopped using the term at some point, that reflects the normal evolution of workplace interactions and sensitivity to interpersonal dynamics. Managers adjust their communication style continuously. A manager who becomes aware -- whether through direct feedback, training, or self-reflection -- that a particular term might be unwelcome and then stops using it is demonstrating exactly the kind of responsive behavior the law encourages. Characterizing self-correction as "consciousness of guilt" penalizes the very behavior anti-discrimination policies are designed to promote.

Regarding Bryan Baptist: calling someone by the wrong name, while embarrassing, is not necessarily an ethnic epithet. In a team environment with multiple members, name confusion happens. If the manager mixed up names -- an unfortunately common occurrence in busy workplaces -- the question is whether there is evidence he chose "Rahul" specifically because Baptist is Indian, or whether it was a genuine confusion with another person in his professional circle. The plaintiff's assumption that the name was chosen because of Baptist's ethnicity is the plaintiff's inference, not an established fact. Baptist, if asked, may characterize the incident very differently than the plaintiff does on his behalf.

The plaintiff's attempt to combine "Comrade" and "Rahul" into a "cross-category pattern of national origin discrimination" takes two informal workplace interactions and constructs a legal theory around them. This is the same approach the plaintiff has taken throughout: reinterpreting normal events through a discrimination lens after the decision to pursue litigation was already made. Before the lawsuit, these were workplace interactions that did not warrant comment. After the lawsuit, they are evidence of pervasive ethnic animus. The transformation says more about the plaintiff's strategic posture than about the manager's intent.

Bloomberg takes all forms of discrimination seriously. It provides regular anti-harassment training to its managers and maintains multiple reporting channels for employees who experience conduct they believe to be discriminatory. The plaintiff availed himself of none of these channels for the "Comrade" allegation -- just as he used none of them for his leave retaliation claims. The first time this allegation appeared was in a conversation with a plaintiff's attorney on February 23, 2026 -- the same day the plaintiff was shopping for legal representation. Its emergence is strategic, not organic.

## The Plaintiff's Own Words Reveal Deliberate Disengagement

Before the 2025 evaluation was written, before the second leave began, and months after the February 2025 compensation decision, the plaintiff told his friends exactly what he was doing:

On March 24, 2025, he wrote: "I used to go above and beyond. They fucked me. So now imma do what I should have been doing."

On March 27, 2025: "I used to think bad about 6 months or feel like I needed to do beyond my hours etc. Now? Nope fuck that."

On April 1, 2025, when a friend commented on how much he was traveling, the plaintiff responded: "I'm doing it on purpose. Given my raise. I need to ensure I'm seeing clients in person" -- followed by a wink emoji -- and: "More time on road less time in office."

These are not the words of an employee who was performing at a high level and was unfairly characterized as an underperformer. These are the words of an employee who, by his own admission, made a deliberate decision to reduce his effort. He used to go above and beyond; he stopped. He used to feel motivated to exceed expectations; he no longer did. He traveled intentionally to avoid the office. He said so, in his own words, to his own friends.

The manager's evaluation found that Aleksandr's effort was insufficient, that his days were too short, that his client visit breadth was inadequate, and that feedback from the prior year had not been implemented. The plaintiff's own contemporaneous statements confirm every one of those findings. He was not a victim of a fabricated narrative. He was an employee who chose to disengage, and his evaluation reflected that choice.

The plaintiff's legal team will argue that the disengagement was itself caused by the first leave's retaliatory aftermath -- that the 0% raise in February 2025 triggered the pullback. They frame this as a "Retaliation Cascade": retaliation in Cycle 1 caused the disengagement, which caused the underperformance, which caused the Cycle 2 evaluation, making the entire chain retaliatory. This theory requires accepting that the first link was retaliatory -- which it was not.

The 0% raise in February 2025 followed a period where the employee was absent for half the evaluation year. The employee's available performance data during his active period did not support an increase. Multiple employees across the organization received comparable compensation outcomes. The 0% raise was a legitimate compensation decision, not a retaliatory act, and the causal chain the plaintiff proposes collapses at its foundation.

Moreover, even if the plaintiff felt the compensation decision was unfair, the law does not excuse deliberate performance reduction as a response. Employees who are dissatisfied with compensation decisions have options: they can discuss concerns with management, pursue internal transfers, seek employment elsewhere, or file complaints through HR or regulatory channels. What they cannot do is deliberately reduce their performance, document themselves doing so in text messages to friends, and then claim the resulting negative evaluation was retaliation for an unrelated protected activity. The plaintiff chose to disengage. The evaluation reflected that choice. The attempt to retroactively recharacterize a voluntary decision to underperform as a consequence of retaliation does not change what happened or why.

## The February 17, 2026 Email Shows Professional Engagement

On the same day as the evaluation meeting, February 17, 2026, the plaintiff sent an email to his manager and his manager's boss:

> Rich and Teddy,
>
> I appreciate the time yesterday and the discussion.
>
> As discussed, I'm focused on Connecticut territory and related accounts. I'm continuing to build relationships and drive activity across that coverage.
>
> I've set a time for us to reconnect and will keep pushing forward on the opportunities.
>
> Thanks Alex

This email is professional and forward-looking. The plaintiff acknowledged the meeting, restated his focus on the agreed coverage area, and committed to continued effort. He did not raise any concerns about the evaluation, did not complain about the process, and did not suggest the meeting was hostile or retaliatory. The email reflects an employee who participated in a constructive performance discussion and was moving forward with the feedback he received.

The absence of any protest, complaint, or expression of distress in the immediate aftermath of the evaluation is notable. The plaintiff's support team subsequently assessed this email as a non-issue -- and that assessment is itself revealing: there was nothing in the email for the plaintiff to walk back because the email simply confirmed professional engagement with the process.

## Sabrina Sparapani's Account Reflects Her Own Grievances, Not Objective Evidence

The plaintiff relies heavily on iMessage communications with Sabrina Sparapani, a former team member who resigned in July 2025. These messages span two periods: conversations in 2024 after the plaintiff returned from his first leave, and a thread in July 2025 around the time of Sabrina's own resignation. The plaintiff presents Sabrina as a second victim of the same manager and a corroborating witness to a pattern of leave retaliation.

The defense must address what Sabrina actually said, what her statements mean, and why they are substantially less powerful than the plaintiff frames them.

**The "carried the baby" comment.** Sabrina reports that the manager said the plaintiff "shouldn't be taking primary leave for 6 months because it's not like he carried the baby." This is now a first-person account from Sabrina rather than pure hearsay -- she claims to have heard it directly. However, the statement reaches the case file through an iMessage thread between Sabrina and the plaintiff, two friends commiserating about a shared former manager. The circumstances of the conversation (informal, between friends, during Sabrina's own acrimonious departure) should be considered when evaluating the precision of her characterization.

Bloomberg's parental leave policy is explicitly gender-neutral. It provides equal leave to fathers and mothers regardless of who "carried the baby." The company's institutional commitment to equitable leave access is documented in policy and practiced across the organization. Even if the manager made a comment reflecting a personal view about the biology of childbirth, that comment did not alter the policy, did not prevent the plaintiff from taking full leave, and did not translate into any documented policy deviation. The plaintiff took the full six months. Twice.

**Sabrina as a "pattern victim."** Sabrina's iMessages include statements like "he retaliates against people who go on leave especially men" and descriptions of her own experience that she characterizes as the "same playbook." These statements are Sabrina's conclusions, not independently established facts. She had her own reasons for dissatisfaction with the manager and with the company. She was in the process of resigning when these messages were sent. A departing employee venting to a friend about a former manager is not the same as a neutral witness providing objective testimony.

Critically, Sabrina's formal willingness to cooperate with a plaintiff's attorney is unknown. Sharing grievances over iMessage with a former colleague is fundamentally different from agreeing to sit for a deposition, provide sworn testimony, and subject herself to cross-examination. If Sabrina declines formal cooperation, her iMessage statements are of limited evidentiary value -- the plaintiff cannot compel her to testify to their content without establishing admissibility under rules that may exclude informal text messages as unreliable.

**Sabrina's credibility challenges.** If Sabrina does cooperate formally, the defense can challenge her credibility on several grounds: (1) she left the company voluntarily during what she describes as a dispute with the same manager, giving her a personal grievance that colors her account; (2) her characterizations of events ("same playbook," "retaliates") are conclusory labels she applied, not factual descriptions of specific actions taken against her; (3) she told the plaintiff that the manager gave him her "shitty accounts" -- but whether accounts were underperforming when assigned and whether that assignment was retaliatory or routine portfolio management are separate questions; (4) her complaints about her own coverage and treatment may reflect the normal friction of sales territory management, not a pattern of leave-based retaliation.

**The HR exit interview claim.** Sabrina told the plaintiff she was "veeeerrrry honest" in her HR exit interview and that she told HR about the manager's conduct. This is Sabrina's self-assessment of her own candor. The content of the exit interview is unknown to either the plaintiff or Sabrina's iMessage account. HR exit interviews routinely capture general complaints about management style, workload, and team dynamics. Whether Sabrina specifically described leave retaliation, whether HR recorded those specific complaints, and whether those notes are damaging depends entirely on what the notes actually say -- not on Sabrina's characterization of how honest she was.

**The defense's position on Sabrina:** She is a former employee with her own grievances, providing her personal characterizations in an informal context to a friend who was building a legal case. Her statements should be evaluated with the skepticism appropriate to their source and circumstances. If she cooperates formally, the defense will challenge her credibility, her bias, and the specificity of her claims. If she does not cooperate, her iMessage statements are an incomplete and unreliable foundation for the plaintiff's pattern theory.

## The Sam Page Comparison Is Speculative

The plaintiff claims that a former employee, Sam Page, experienced an "identical" sequence under the same manager: parental leave, negative evaluation, coverage stripped, PIP, eventual separation. The plaintiff presents this as evidence of a pattern.

What the plaintiff actually has is his own secondhand characterization of a former colleague's experience. He was not privy to Sam Page's evaluations, his PIP documentation, his performance data, or the circumstances of his separation. He is assuming that because two employees on the same team received performance management, and both had taken parental leave, the leave must be the connecting factor. That is a logical fallacy. Employees receive PIPs for performance reasons. Employees leave companies for many reasons. The fact that an employee took parental leave and later received a PIP does not mean the PIP was because of the leave.

If Sam Page's employment file shows documented, legitimate, specific performance deficiencies that were identified and addressed through Bloomberg's standard performance management process, the parallel the plaintiff draws dissolves. Until the actual facts of Sam Page's situation are examined -- his evaluations, his performance data, the documented basis for any PIP, and the circumstances of his departure -- the plaintiff's characterization is speculation dressed as evidence.

Bloomberg will produce Sam Page's employment records in discovery if required, and those records will speak for themselves.

## The Forecast Tampering Allegation Is Unverified and Inconsistent

The plaintiff claims that in September 2025, while he was on parental leave, the manager closed a forecast of approximately $58,000 as a "duplicate," stripped the associated notes, and reopened it under the manager's own name the same day. The plaintiff characterizes this as fraud -- deliberate suppression of his revenue numbers to justify the subsequent negative evaluation.

This allegation rests entirely on the plaintiff's account. No independent evidence has been presented or reviewed. The plaintiff's own support team labels it "partially confirmed" with "details pending." They have explicitly told the plaintiff not to report it to FINRA until an attorney reviews it -- an acknowledgment that the claim needs verification before it can be acted upon.

Several facts undermine the allegation as presented. First, the dollar amounts do not reconcile. The plaintiff says the forecast was approximately $58,000. The evaluation references $53,800 for the Two Seas deal, and the evaluation credited this revenue to the employee -- stating "we were able to book" the deal. If the manager's goal was to steal the employee's revenue credit, he failed: the revenue appears in the evaluation as a positive for the employee. Second, the word "we" in "we were able to book" is standard managerial language describing team accomplishments, not an attempt to strip individual credit. Third, CRM maintenance is a routine part of sales management. Managers regularly clean up forecasts, consolidate duplicates, correct entries, and update deal statuses. Closing a forecast as "duplicate" and reopening it is a workflow action that occurs across Bloomberg's CRM system daily.

The CRM audit trail exists. It will show exactly what happened on September 5, 2025: who created the original entry, who modified it, what the modification was, and whether the action was routine maintenance or something more concerning. If the trail shows a legitimate business action -- consolidating a genuine duplicate, correcting a misattributed entry, or performing standard pipeline cleanup -- the allegation collapses entirely and the plaintiff's credibility is damaged by having raised it. The company should pull this audit trail immediately.

## The Chain of Command Does Not Excuse Failure to Use Available Channels

The plaintiff's team has mapped the chain of command above the manager: Rich Santore (the manager's boss, present at the February 17 evaluation) and Hal (Santore's boss, described as the manager's personal friend). The plaintiff frames this as evidence that internal escalation was futile, preempting any argument that he should have complained through Bloomberg's internal channels.

This framing ignores that Bloomberg, like every major financial services company, has formal complaint mechanisms that are independent of the direct reporting chain. The plaintiff could have contacted HR, used an anonymous ethics hotline, spoken to an HR business partner outside his team, or filed a complaint with Bloomberg's compliance department. He did none of these things. The fact that his manager's boss was in the room during the evaluation does not eliminate every other channel available to him.

Santore's presence at the evaluation was standard management practice. Senior managers routinely attend direct-report evaluations. If Santore reviewed the evaluation content and found it reasonable, that represents a second institutional actor who independently assessed the performance data -- oversight, not complicity. The plaintiff's suggestion that Santore's presence proves the chain of command is "compromised" conflates oversight with participation in alleged wrongdoing.

As for Hal, the plaintiff's evidence of his friendship with the manager consists of the plaintiff's recollection that the manager mentioned it and that the plaintiff overheard the manager inviting Hal to his house. A personal acquaintance between executives two levels apart does not establish that Hal participated in, condoned, or was even aware of the alleged treatment. Executives in large organizations know each other socially. This is not evidence of a conspiracy.

## The Corey Levine Statement Is Irrelevant

The plaintiff reports that the manager made comments about Corey Levine, an employee on a different team, saying Levine would not become a manager because he took six months off. The plaintiff uses this to argue the manager harbors generalized hostility toward employees who take extended leave.

Two facts undermine this characterization. First, Corey Levine was on a different team and was not managed by the plaintiff's manager. The manager's opinion about an employee on a different team's promotion prospects has no bearing on management decisions made about his own direct reports. Second, and more importantly, Corey Levine did become a manager. Whatever the manager may have said about Levine's prospects, it had no effect on the outcome. Levine was promoted. The system worked. A stray opinion that did not translate into any adverse action against the person it was about -- and that concerned a person on a different team -- is not evidence of a retaliatory pattern against the plaintiff.

## The Job Posting Was Additional Headcount, Not a Replacement

In July 2025, while the plaintiff was on leave, a role on the team was posted publicly. The plaintiff claims this was his position being permanently replaced in violation of FMLA's restoration obligations.

The posting was for additional headcount. The team was operating with reduced capacity: the plaintiff was on leave, Bryan Baptist had left the company, and Sabrina had departed. Bloomberg needed to staff the team to maintain client coverage. Hiring additional sales professionals during a period of reduced headcount is a standard business response to understaffing, not evidence of intent to replace an employee on leave.

The plaintiff returned from leave on December 28, 2025, to the same position, the same team, the same title, and the same reporting structure. His role was not eliminated, his responsibilities were not transferred, and he was not told his position no longer existed. Bloomberg's obligation under FMLA -- to restore the employee to the same or equivalent position -- was fully met. The plaintiff returned, sat down, and went back to work. The fact that the team hired additional staff during a period when it was critically short-handed is evidence of responsible management, not FMLA interference.

## The February 2026 Compensation Decisions Reflected Company-Wide Conditions

On February 11, 2026 -- six days before the plaintiff's evaluation meeting -- Bloomberg conducted significant organizational restructuring. Many employees across the company were affected. Numerous employees received no raises and reduced or eliminated bonuses. The plaintiff himself documented this in his group chat: "Apparently a ton of people got fired and many got zero raises and shit." "Many got shit to no raises or bonuses."

The plaintiff's compensation outcome -- no raise, no bonus -- occurred within this broader context. It was not an individually targeted decision driven by parental leave. It was consistent with the compensation austerity applied across the organization during a period of significant restructuring. The company does not deny that the plaintiff's performance evaluation informed his compensation outcome. But the evaluation reflected genuine performance concerns, and the compensation decision was consistent with a company-wide posture that affected employees who had never taken any parental leave at all.

## The Colleague Comment Is Workplace Speculation

The plaintiff reports that after his evaluation, a colleague commented: "That's what happens when you have a kid." The plaintiff presents this as evidence that retaliation was openly recognized by peers.

This is an offhand remark by an unnamed individual who has no involvement in the plaintiff's evaluation, compensation, or management. It reflects one person's speculation about a colleague's situation. Coworkers speculate about management decisions constantly. A sympathetic remark from a friend does not constitute evidence that the management decision was actually motivated by the assumed reason. If a colleague said "that's what happens when you miss your numbers," it would not prove the evaluation was numbers-based. The logic is the same in reverse.

## The Health Data Reflects New Parenthood, Not Retaliation

The plaintiff presents Oura Ring and Apple Watch data showing elevated heart rate and disrupted sleep in the days following his evaluation. He attributes this to the emotional impact of workplace retaliation.

Receiving a negative performance review is stressful. That is true for any employee, regardless of whether the review is retaliatory or legitimate. Stress following critical feedback is a universal human experience, not evidence that the feedback was unlawful.

Additionally, the plaintiff had just returned from parental leave with a young infant. Sleep disruption, elevated resting heart rate, and stress indicators are well-documented features of new parenthood. The plaintiff's physiological data from the days following his evaluation cannot be attributed exclusively to the evaluation when there are obvious confounding variables -- including a baby at home who was approximately five months old.

The plaintiff was also awake at 4:51 AM researching "NYC Paternity Leave Notice" on ChatGPT and consulting with his support team about legal strategy. His elevated stress may reflect the anxiety of contemplating litigation as much as the anxiety of receiving feedback. The device data does not distinguish between these causes.

## The Manager's Pregnancy Inquiries Were Responsive, Not Intrusive

The plaintiff claims the manager "kept asking" about his wife's pregnancy. The plaintiff's own messages reveal that he "hinted" to the manager about the pregnancy before formally disclosing it. A manager who follows up on information an employee voluntarily shared is engaging in normal workplace conversation, not conducting surveillance. "How long is she?" is a question that friends, family members, and colleagues ask routinely when they learn someone is expecting.

Bloomberg's parental leave policy requires advance notice so the company can plan coverage. The manager's awareness of the expected timeline was consistent with standard leave planning. It would have been more unusual for the manager not to ask follow-up questions after the employee himself raised the subject.

---

## The Mandatory Review Scheduling Was an Oversight

The plaintiff reports that the manager scheduled a mandatory in-person review for August 8, 2025, during the plaintiff's approved leave period. When the plaintiff pointed out the conflict, the manager said he would check with HR. The plaintiff was not required to attend. He went on leave as scheduled. No adverse consequence resulted from this incident.

This was a calendar invitation sent to the full team. The manager's immediate response -- checking with HR -- demonstrates appropriate handling, not retaliatory intent. In the logistics of managing a team with overlapping leave schedules and shifting availability, a calendar overlap is an administrative matter, not evidence of a hostile work environment.

## The WFH Denial Followed Company Policy

On June 24, 2025, the plaintiff requested to work from home because his child was sick. The manager directed him to take a sick day instead. The plaintiff characterizes this as hostility toward his caregiver status.

Bloomberg has policies governing work-from-home days and sick days. If an employee is unable to perform normal work duties because they are providing care for a sick child, the appropriate classification under Bloomberg's policies may be a sick day rather than a WFH day. The manager applied policy as he understood it. The plaintiff took a sick day. Bloomberg provides unlimited sick days. There was no reduction in pay, no disciplinary consequence, and no impact on the plaintiff's employment. The manager's decision may have been rigid, but rigidity in applying workplace policies is not retaliation for parental leave. If the manager applied the same policy distinction to other employees under comparable circumstances -- and the company's records will show whether he did -- there is no disparate treatment.

## The PIP Discussion Was Transparent and Supportive

The year-end evaluation stated: "while we are not placing Alex on a PIP at this time and it is something I would like to avoid in the future it does remain a possibility unless the efforts and results rise to a level more inline with the expectations of the role."

Read this sentence carefully. The manager is telling the employee: I am not putting you on a PIP. I want to avoid putting you on a PIP. I believe you can avoid a PIP by improving your effort and results. This is not a threat. It is transparency. It is a manager being honest with a veteran employee about where things stand and what the employee needs to do to get back on track.

Performance improvement plans are a standard management tool used across Bloomberg and the financial services industry. They are not punishment. They are structured support for employees who need to close a performance gap. Mentioning the possibility of a PIP in the context of an evaluation that identifies specific improvement areas is responsible management. The alternative -- blindsiding an employee with a PIP without any warning -- is the approach that employment lawyers criticize. This manager chose the transparent path.

## The Seating Change Was Routine

In August 2024, the team's seating arrangement changed. The plaintiff was moved to sit near the manager. The plaintiff characterized this alternately as potential monitoring and as possibly being given a better seat. His own messages confirm the move was part of a broader rearrangement: "They moving all our seats." Team-wide seating changes are routine office logistics. In sales environments, managers frequently sit among their teams. The plaintiff's own ambivalence about the move -- he thought it might be positive -- undercuts the suggestion that it was punitive.

## The Plaintiff's Support Network Manufactured a Narrative

The evidence will show that the plaintiff has been working with a support team since at least early February 2026 to construct a legal case. This team has created a detailed case file, developed a seven-principle communications strategy for employer-facing emails, drafted and rejected multiple versions of follow-up correspondence based on their strategic value as evidence, maintained an evidence log tracking the "strategic impact" of each event, researched plaintiff-side employment law firms, and designed email language specifically to "force" the manager into responses that would generate evidence.

The communications strategy document explicitly states that the plaintiff's emails should "generate evidence through questions, not assertions." It identifies evidence "held in reserve" that the plaintiff should not deploy until an attorney directs him to. It notes that the plaintiff's first instinct -- to send a genuine, grateful follow-up email to his manager -- was wrong, and that future emails should be engineered to create a litigation record.

None of this means the underlying facts are fabricated. But it means that the narrative being presented is not the organic experience of a man who was mistreated at work. It is a carefully constructed legal strategy, assembled by a team that decided the conclusion before examining the evidence and then organized every fact to support that conclusion. The evaluation was written before the support team activated. The plaintiff's genuine reaction to the evaluation was to send a thank-you email expressing appreciation and alignment. Everything that followed -- the reframing, the evidence collection, the strategic withholding -- was manufactured.

The national origin claims illustrate this pattern precisely. "Comrade" was allegedly used for over a year. During that entire year, the plaintiff never objected, never reported it, and never mentioned it in the group chat where he documented every other workplace grievance. It appeared for the first time on February 23, 2026 -- during attorney intake calls. The plaintiff's team did not "discover" discrimination; they recognized that an informal greeting could be recharacterized as one, and they added it to the case file on the same day they began shopping for a lawyer.

## Bloomberg's Commitment to the Plaintiff's Success

Bloomberg LP has invested thirteen and a half years in Aleksandr Akulov. It paid for his education. It paid his full salary during twelve months of parental leave across two children. It held his position both times. It returned him to his role both times. When his performance lagged, it provided specific, documented feedback about what needed to change. It did not place him on a PIP -- it warned him that one might become necessary if performance did not improve, while expressing hope that it could be avoided. It gave him a roadmap: get in front of more clients, broaden coverage engagement, convert pipeline to revenue, adopt strategic campaigns.

This is not the behavior of a company trying to push out an employee for taking parental leave. This is the behavior of a company trying to retain a veteran employee by being honest with him about where he stands and what he needs to do. The manager wrote: "Alex historically has proven that he has the skill set to be successful in the group." That is not a man building a case for termination. That is a manager who believes in his employee's potential and is frustrated that the potential is not being realized.

The company's door remains open. The evaluation identified the problem. The manager provided the path forward. The question is whether Aleksandr Akulov will walk through that door -- or whether he will let a support team convince him that the door is a trap.

## The Mariner/RFQE Work During Leave Shows Management Responsiveness

The plaintiff will point out that he logged into Bloomberg systems during his second parental leave to conduct a product demo for a client (Mariner), which his manager acknowledged. The plaintiff frames this as evidence of exceptional commitment that went unrecognized.

The evaluation explicitly acknowledges the Mariner RFQE onboard. It states the engagement "did not lead to any bookable events in 2025" because the resulting revenue ($31,600) closed on January 5, 2026 -- after the evaluation period. The plaintiff will receive credit for that revenue in 2026. Nothing was omitted; the evaluation accurately reflected what had occurred within the evaluation period.

As for the plaintiff's voluntary engagement during leave: that is commendable, and the company does not discourage employees from staying connected if they choose to. But the evaluation assessed the active working period (January through July 2025), not leave-period activity. The manager's decision not to require or even encourage work during leave was actually protecting the plaintiff's leave rights -- exactly the opposite of what the plaintiff claims the company was doing.

## Summary

This is a performance management case, not a retaliation case and not a discrimination case. An employee with a thirteen-year track record took extended parental leave, as was his right, and Bloomberg honored that right completely. When the employee returned, his performance during the available working period fell short of his peers and short of the role's expectations. His manager documented specific, measurable deficiencies. The employee himself admitted to friends that he had deliberately reduced his effort. The evaluation reflected what the data showed and what the employee himself confirmed.

The coverage decisions that followed Aleksandr's leaves were driven by business continuity needs, client relationship preservation, and team capacity management. The compensation decisions reflected both the individual evaluation and a company-wide environment in which many employees received no raises. The verbal statements attributed to the manager are the plaintiff's characterizations of private conversations, filtered through an increasingly adversarial lens and organized by a support team that was building a lawsuit before the evaluation was even delivered.

The national origin allegations -- "Comrade" and "Rahul" -- emerged for the first time on February 23, 2026, the same day the plaintiff was conducting intake calls with plaintiff's attorneys. These were informal workplace interactions that the plaintiff never objected to, never reported, and never mentioned to anyone during the year-plus they allegedly occurred. Their sudden recharacterization as discrimination coincides precisely with the plaintiff's litigation strategy, not with any change in the workplace environment. The manager used informal greetings common in high-pressure sales environments. If he adjusted his language over time, that reflects responsive management, not an admission of wrongdoing.

The plaintiff's supporting evidence -- a former team member's iMessage grievances, an unverified forecast tampering allegation, a chain-of-command mapping designed to preempt internal complaint arguments, and now a national origin claim that never bothered the plaintiff until he needed it for a lawsuit -- adds volume to the narrative without adding verified substance. Sabrina Sparapani is a former employee with her own grievances, sharing characterizations with a friend over text. The forecast tampering claim is the plaintiff's account of a CRM action whose audit trail has not been reviewed. The chain of command theory ignores every formal complaint channel Bloomberg provides. The "Comrade" allegation was never raised through any channel until it was disclosed to a plaintiff's attorney.

Bloomberg values its employees. It values parental leave as a benefit and a right. It does not punish employees for using that benefit. It does not tolerate discrimination based on national origin or any other protected characteristic. What it does require -- of every employee, regardless of leave history or background -- is performance consistent with the expectations of the role. When performance falls short, Bloomberg provides feedback. That is what happened here. The plaintiff asks you to see retaliation and discrimination where there is accountability. The evidence does not support that conclusion.
