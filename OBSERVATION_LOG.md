## Entry 001: Initial Full Read-Through

**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Files reviewed:** All 11 .md files + 6 image files in `/Users/alex/dev/sasha/`
**Changes since last review:** N/A (first read)

### What the employee's team has assembled

This is an unusually well-organized pre-litigation file. It was built by a friend (Aleksey Shenker) who is not an attorney but has been functioning as a de facto case manager. The file includes:

- Verbatim evaluation transcriptions with line-by-line analysis
- Counter-metrics from Bloomberg's own systems showing the employee led the team in activity
- A 25-section WhatsApp chronology spanning 3 years with contemporaneous timestamps
- An iMessage thread providing independent corroboration of key events
- Wearable device health data documenting physiological stress response
- A communications strategy document revealing their principles and rejected drafts
- Coverage universe data showing 2.2x-5.4x disparity between the employee and peers
- Attorney firm research with specific case citations and a prioritized contact list
- An event log tracking every development since the Feb 17 evaluation

### Key facts from initial read

**The evaluation itself is the primary liability.** The manager's own year-end evaluation:
- Opens by noting Sasha was on parental leave for the second half
- Compares half-year metrics against full-year peers with no prorating
- The mid-year "Looking Forward" section explicitly states leave prevents improvement, then the year-end uses exactly those unimproved metrics
- Contains "Alex historically has proven that he has the skill set to be successful" -- an admission the decline is recent and coincides with leave
- Threatens PIP based on this half-year data

**The coverage disparity is quantified.** Bloomberg's own internal document shows:
- Sasha: 1,138 firms (lowest on team)
- Next peer: 2,529 firms (2.2x)
- James Johnston (1-month leave): 6,099 firms (5.4x)
- Revenue target increased 52% ($115k to $175k) while coverage was stripped

**The "thought you were quitting" admission.** Manager told Sasha he ranked him low because he assumed Sasha was leaving during leave. This is ranking based on speculation during protected leave, not performance.

**The "we didn't cut your pay" comment.** Manager said "we like you a lot we don't cut your pay and you were away for 6 months." This directly ties compensation to leave.

**Sam Page pattern.** A prior employee under the same manager allegedly experienced: leave taken -> coverage stripped -> PIP -> pushed out. If corroborated, this transforms isolated incident into pattern.

**Witness list is substantial:**
- Sabrina: "carried the baby" comment (gender dimension)
- Corey Levine: manager said leave blocked promotion
- Noah Aris: corroborated firing joke twice in WhatsApp
- Erb: independent contemporaneous texts about review and second firing joke
- Unnamed colleague: "that's what happens when you have a kid"
- Unnamed female coworker (now at BlackRock): warned "be alert" re: leave

**The email Sasha already sent is a mixed bag.** He sent a thank-you email on Feb 17 that contains concessions ("I appreciate the continued guidance," "I'm aligned on continuing to prioritize"). Their team assessed it as a setback but not fatal. They planned a stronger email that was never sent.

### Attorney status

No attorney retained yet as of Feb 20. Sasha plans to call firms on a sick day Monday Feb 24. Their recommended order: (1) Outten & Golden, (2) Cohen Milstein/Clancy, (3) Phillips & Associates. All three have relevant case history. Cohen Milstein/Clancy are currently suing Bloomberg in Ndugga v. Bloomberg (SDNY, active).

### Their communication strategy reveals their playbook

They have 7 communication principles designed to:
1. Never concede the leave-performance link
2. Keep counter-evidence hidden from the employer until litigation
3. Generate evidence through questions rather than assertions
4. Make every email pass a "Bloomberg legal review" test
5. Focus forward (coverage restoration, goals) rather than backward (rebuttal)
6. Get verbal statements into writing without sounding like documentation
7. Distinguish acknowledgment from concession

They are holding substantial evidence in reserve for the attorney: counter-metrics, the "quitting" admission, the "didn't cut your pay" comment, firing jokes, Sabrina's testimony, Sam Page pattern, job posting during leave, pregnancy questions, and health data.

### Upcoming events to monitor

1. **Attorney consultation:** Planned for week of Feb 24. Once retained, the dynamic changes fundamentally.
2. **Follow-up meeting with manager:** ~March 5-10. They plan pre-meeting and post-meeting emails as evidence-generating touchpoints.
3. **Pre-meeting email:** Intended to put coverage stripping, PIP status, and 2026 expectations in writing.
4. **Stats email debate:** Sasha wants to send counter-metrics to manager. Team advises against. Decision deferred to attorney.

### Implications for defense

1. **The manager's own words are the biggest problem.** The evaluation is written in a way that a competent plaintiff's attorney will shred. Half-year vs. full-year comparisons, explicit leave references, "historically successful" admission, and PIP threat all in one document.
2. **The coverage disparity data is objective and from Bloomberg's systems.** This cannot be disputed. The 5.4x gap between Sasha and Johnston is the strongest single piece of evidence they have.
3. **The temporal pattern is tight.** Two consecutive leave-return-adverse action cycles from the same manager. A jury will see this immediately.
4. **Sam Page is the wild card.** If he cooperates, this goes from a strong individual case to a pattern case. Must determine whether Sam Page has any relationship with Bloomberg that would discourage cooperation.
5. **Their communication strategy is sophisticated.** They are deliberately generating evidence through "innocent" emails while holding their strongest material for litigation. Every response to Sasha's communications should be treated as potentially creating evidence.
6. **The attorney firms they're targeting are first-tier for this exact case type.** Outten & Golden's JPMorgan paternity case and Cohen Milstein's active Bloomberg suit mean they will face experienced opposing counsel with existing institutional knowledge.

### What to watch for next read

- Whether Sasha retained an attorney (check Event_Log.md)
- Whether the March meeting happened and what was said
- Whether new emails were sent or received
- Any updates to the witness list (especially Sam Page contact)
- Any new evidence added to Adverse_Actions file
- Changes to Communications_Strategy principles or draft log

## Entry 002: Second Read-Through -- Monday Playbook Discovered

**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Files reviewed:** All files in `/Users/alex/dev/sasha/` re-read. All defense documents in `/Users/alex/dev/sasha-defense/` cross-checked.
**Changes since last review:** One new file discovered: `Monday_Playbook.md`

### New file: Monday_Playbook.md

This is a fully operational attorney outreach playbook dated Monday, February 23, 2026. It was not present in the original file inventory (Entry 001). Its existence confirms the employee's support team has moved from evidence collection and strategy into active execution of attorney outreach.

### What the playbook contains

**Firm prioritization (finalized order):**

1. **Cohen Milstein / The Clancy Law Firm** -- Lead priority. The playbook instructs Sasha to call Cohen Milstein first at (212) 838-7797, ask for the Ndugga v. Bloomberg team or employment discrimination practice. If that fails, call Donna Clancy directly at (212) 747-1744. Specific instruction: mention the existing Bloomberg litigation.
2. **Phillips & Associates** -- (866) 229-9441. Cited for the $1.8M Pardovani verdict. Free consultations.
3. **Outten & Golden** -- (212) 390-8206. Cited for Rotondo v. JPMorgan Chase ($5M settlement). The playbook says "worth calling even if you retain someone from the first two."
4. **Wigdor LLP** -- (212) 257-6800. Described as having "$1.5 billion in total verdicts and settlements." Positioned as the high-firepower backup if the first three don't work.
5. **Derek Smith Law Group** -- (212) 587-0760. Cited for $1.5M paternity leave settlement and "largest emotional distress jury verdict upheld on appeal in the US." Specifically flagged because Sasha has device-recorded physiological data.

**Note on reordering:** In Entry 001, the Event_Log showed a recommended order of (1) Outten & Golden, (2) Cohen Milstein/Clancy, (3) Phillips & Associates. The Monday Playbook has moved Cohen Milstein/Clancy to the #1 position and expanded the list from 3 to 5 firms. This suggests the support team concluded that connecting Sasha's case to the active Ndugga litigation is the highest-value first move.

**Scripted intake call:**

The playbook provides a verbatim opening script:

> "Hi, my name is Aleksandr Akulov. I'm a current employee at Bloomberg LP. I'm calling about a potential parental leave retaliation case. I took about six months of parental leave, and since returning I've experienced retaliation including a negative performance review, loss of client coverage, and threats of a PIP. I have 14 years of tenure and documentation."

For Cohen Milstein specifically, he adds: "I understand your firm is currently representing plaintiffs in a discrimination case against Bloomberg. I think my situation may be relevant to that."

If asked for more detail: "I've been at Bloomberg for 14 years in sales. I took parental leave from approximately July through December 2025. When I returned, my client coverage had been reduced, I received a negative performance review that explicitly referenced my leave, I got no raise and no bonus, and I was verbally threatened with a PIP. I'm still employed. The year-end evaluation was delivered on February 17, 2026."

If asked about documentation: "Yes, I have performance data from the company's own systems, text messages, and a group chat with contemporaneous accounts from colleagues."

**Scripted consultation callback:**

The playbook provides a structured narrative for when a lawyer calls back, organized in seven sections: (1) tenure and track record, (2) the leave details, (3) coverage stripping during leave, (4) the evaluation and return, (5) manager's statements, (6) Sam Page pattern, (7) actual performance data.

**Critical disclosure requirement:**

The playbook makes the WhatsApp disclosure mandatory and non-negotiable. Sasha must tell the attorney about the "pulling back on discretionary effort" messages before they develop any strategy:

> "I should flag something that would come up in discovery. After I found out about the zero raise in early 2025, I vented in a group chat with friends. I said things about pulling back on discretionary effort and being frustrated with the company. Those messages exist and they'd be discoverable. I want you to know about that upfront."

This is significant because it means the attorney will know about the strongest defense weapon from day one and will build strategy around it rather than being blindsided.

**Call recording instructions:**

The playbook instructs Sasha to record every call. New York is a one-party consent state. Method: speaker phone with a second device running a voice recorder. Explicit warning NOT to use iPhone's iOS 18 built-in recording (announces to all parties). Recordings will be transcribed via Otter.ai or Whisper.

This means transcripts of every attorney intake conversation will exist and can be shared with the support team for analysis.

**Firm-specific questions:**

- Cohen Milstein/Clancy: "Would my case be connected to the existing Ndugga litigation, or handled separately?"
- Derek Smith Law Group: "I have objective health data -- my fitness ring and smartwatch recorded elevated heart rate and stress levels in the days after the evaluation, significantly above my baseline. I also have contemporaneous texts and emails from that same timeframe showing I wasn't sleeping. Is that something you'd use?"

**Post-call instructions:**

- Write down who you spoke with and what they said
- Do NOT send any Bloomberg documents; only personal records from personal devices
- Text "Al" (Aleksey Shenker) with updates
- Do not retain any firm until speaking with at least 2-3

### Strategic implications for defense

1. **Attorney outreach is operationalized.** This is no longer "planning to call attorneys." The support team has produced a polished execution document with scripts, phone numbers, firm-specific strategies, and recording procedures. Calls happen Monday, February 23 -- two days from now. Attorney retention could follow within days.

2. **Cohen Milstein is now the lead target.** The decision to prioritize the firm already litigating against Bloomberg in Ndugga is a significant escalation signal. If Donna Clancy takes this case, she brings four years of Bloomberg-specific discovery, institutional knowledge, and existing litigation infrastructure. This was identified as a risk in LITIGATION_PREP.md Section 7.6. The Monday Playbook confirms it is now the primary strategy.

3. **Five firms, not three.** Entry 001 documented three target firms. The playbook adds Wigdor LLP and Derek Smith Law Group, increasing the probability that at least one top-tier firm takes the case. Wigdor's presence is notable -- they handle the highest-value Wall Street discrimination cases.

4. **The WhatsApp disclosure strategy is smart.** By disclosing the "pulling back on effort" messages upfront, the employee's team ensures no attorney is blindsided by the strongest defense argument. This means any firm that takes the case has already factored in the WhatsApp risk and concluded the case is still worth pursuing. It also means the attorney will have a prepared counter-narrative (the "retaliation cascade" theory from Adverse_Actions Section F) ready before the company can deploy those messages.

5. **Call recordings create additional evidence.** The transcripts of these intake calls will document exactly how Sasha presents the case. If his oral account is consistent with the written case file, it strengthens credibility. If any firm declines the case, the reason why could also be informative (though attorney-client privilege may limit this).

6. **Derek Smith specifically chosen for health data.** The inclusion of Derek Smith Law Group, with its record emotional distress verdict, and the firm-specific question about physiological data, suggests the support team is building a damages-maximization strategy around the Oura Ring and Apple Watch evidence.

### Updated timeline

| Date | Event | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 23, 2026 (Monday) | Sasha calls up to 5 attorney firms using the Monday Playbook | IMMINENT |
| Feb 23-28, 2026 | Attorney consultations/callbacks expected | IMMINENT |
| ~Mar 1-7, 2026 | Attorney retention decision (after speaking with 2-3 firms) | NEAR-TERM |
| ~Mar 5-10, 2026 | Follow-up meeting with manager | NEAR-TERM |

### Impact on defense posture

The timeline for action items in LITIGATION_PREP.md has compressed. The 48-hour window for retaining external employment counsel (Priority 2) is now effectively zero margin. If Sasha calls Cohen Milstein on Monday and Donna Clancy's team is interested (given their active Bloomberg litigation, they almost certainly will be), the employee could have experienced counsel within a week. The company's defense counsel must be retained and briefed before this happens, or the company will be playing catch-up from the start.

### What to watch for next read

- Whether any firm has been retained (check Event_Log.md for new events)
- Whether the Monday calls happened as planned
- Whether new communications were sent to the employer
- Whether the March meeting date has been confirmed
- Any new files added to the case directory
- Changes to Event_Log pending items (especially the "stats email" debate -- if the attorney advises on this, the communication posture could shift)
