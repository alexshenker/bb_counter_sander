## Entry 001: Initial Full Read-Through

**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Files reviewed:** All 11 .md files + 6 image files in `/Users/alex/dev/sasha/`
**Changes since last review:** N/A (first read)

### What the employee's team has assembled

This is an unusually well-organized pre-litigation file. It was built by a friend (Aleksey Shenker) who is not an attorney but has been functioning as a de facto case manager. The file includes:

- Verbatim evaluation transcriptions with line-by-line analysis
- Counter-metrics from Bloomberg's own systems showing the employee led the team in activity
- A 25-section WhatsApp chronology spanning 3 years with contemporaneous timestamps
- An iMessage thread providing independent corroboration of key events
- Wearable device health data documenting physiological stress response
- A communications strategy document revealing their principles and rejected drafts
- Coverage universe data showing 2.2x-5.4x disparity between the employee and peers
- Attorney firm research with specific case citations and a prioritized contact list
- An event log tracking every development since the Feb 17 evaluation

### Key facts from initial read

**The evaluation itself is the primary liability.** The manager's own year-end evaluation:
- Opens by noting Sasha was on parental leave for the second half
- Compares half-year metrics against full-year peers with no prorating
- The mid-year "Looking Forward" section explicitly states leave prevents improvement, then the year-end uses exactly those unimproved metrics
- Contains "Alex historically has proven that he has the skill set to be successful" -- an admission the decline is recent and coincides with leave
- Threatens PIP based on this half-year data

**The coverage disparity is quantified.** Bloomberg's own internal document shows:
- Sasha: 1,138 firms (lowest on team)
- Next peer: 2,529 firms (2.2x)
- James Johnston (1-month leave): 6,099 firms (5.4x)
- Revenue target increased 52% ($115k to $175k) while coverage was stripped

**The "thought you were quitting" admission.** Manager told Sasha he ranked him low because he assumed Sasha was leaving during leave. This is ranking based on speculation during protected leave, not performance.

**The "we didn't cut your pay" comment.** Manager said "we like you a lot we don't cut your pay and you were away for 6 months." This directly ties compensation to leave.

**Sam Page pattern.** A prior employee under the same manager allegedly experienced: leave taken -> coverage stripped -> PIP -> pushed out. If corroborated, this transforms isolated incident into pattern.

**Witness list is substantial:**
- Sabrina: "carried the baby" comment (gender dimension)
- Corey Levine: manager said leave blocked promotion
- Noah Aris: corroborated firing joke twice in WhatsApp
- Erb: independent contemporaneous texts about review and second firing joke
- Unnamed colleague: "that's what happens when you have a kid"
- Unnamed female coworker (now at BlackRock): warned "be alert" re: leave

**The email Sasha already sent is a mixed bag.** He sent a thank-you email on Feb 17 that contains concessions ("I appreciate the continued guidance," "I'm aligned on continuing to prioritize"). Their team assessed it as a setback but not fatal. They planned a stronger email that was never sent.

### Attorney status

No attorney retained yet as of Feb 20. Sasha plans to call firms on a sick day Monday Feb 24. Their recommended order: (1) Outten & Golden, (2) Cohen Milstein/Clancy, (3) Phillips & Associates. All three have relevant case history. Cohen Milstein/Clancy are currently suing Bloomberg in Ndugga v. Bloomberg (SDNY, active).

### Their communication strategy reveals their playbook

They have 7 communication principles designed to:
1. Never concede the leave-performance link
2. Keep counter-evidence hidden from the employer until litigation
3. Generate evidence through questions rather than assertions
4. Make every email pass a "Bloomberg legal review" test
5. Focus forward (coverage restoration, goals) rather than backward (rebuttal)
6. Get verbal statements into writing without sounding like documentation
7. Distinguish acknowledgment from concession

They are holding substantial evidence in reserve for the attorney: counter-metrics, the "quitting" admission, the "didn't cut your pay" comment, firing jokes, Sabrina's testimony, Sam Page pattern, job posting during leave, pregnancy questions, and health data.

### Upcoming events to monitor

1. **Attorney consultation:** Planned for week of Feb 24. Once retained, the dynamic changes fundamentally.
2. **Follow-up meeting with manager:** ~March 5-10. They plan pre-meeting and post-meeting emails as evidence-generating touchpoints.
3. **Pre-meeting email:** Intended to put coverage stripping, PIP status, and 2026 expectations in writing.
4. **Stats email debate:** Sasha wants to send counter-metrics to manager. Team advises against. Decision deferred to attorney.

### Implications for defense

1. **The manager's own words are the biggest problem.** The evaluation is written in a way that a competent plaintiff's attorney will shred. Half-year vs. full-year comparisons, explicit leave references, "historically successful" admission, and PIP threat all in one document.
2. **The coverage disparity data is objective and from Bloomberg's systems.** This cannot be disputed. The 5.4x gap between Sasha and Johnston is the strongest single piece of evidence they have.
3. **The temporal pattern is tight.** Two consecutive leave-return-adverse action cycles from the same manager. A jury will see this immediately.
4. **Sam Page is the wild card.** If he cooperates, this goes from a strong individual case to a pattern case. Must determine whether Sam Page has any relationship with Bloomberg that would discourage cooperation.
5. **Their communication strategy is sophisticated.** They are deliberately generating evidence through "innocent" emails while holding their strongest material for litigation. Every response to Sasha's communications should be treated as potentially creating evidence.
6. **The attorney firms they're targeting are first-tier for this exact case type.** Outten & Golden's JPMorgan paternity case and Cohen Milstein's active Bloomberg suit mean they will face experienced opposing counsel with existing institutional knowledge.

### What to watch for next read

- Whether Sasha retained an attorney (check Event_Log.md)
- Whether the March meeting happened and what was said
- Whether new emails were sent or received
- Any updates to the witness list (especially Sam Page contact)
- Any new evidence added to Adverse_Actions file
- Changes to Communications_Strategy principles or draft log
