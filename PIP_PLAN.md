## Section 1: Preliminary Requirements

**No PIP should be implemented until every item in this section is completed.** Implementing a PIP without these prerequisites converts a defensible performance management action into evidence of pretext.

### 1.1 Coverage Must Be Equalized or Targets Must Be Adjusted

**The problem:** The employee has 1,138 assigned firms. His peers have 2,529, 4,036, and 6,099. His 2026 revenue target is $175,000, representing $153.78 per assigned firm. If his peers have the same target, they need $28.69 to $69.20 per firm. A PIP that requires revenue production at a rate per firm that is 2x-5x what his peers must produce is facially pretextual. No amount of careful drafting survives the math.

**The requirement:** Before a PIP can be implemented, one of the following must occur:

**Option A: Equalize coverage.** Restore the employee's coverage to a level comparable to at least the next-lowest peer (P, at 2,529 firms). This means adding approximately 1,400 firms. The restored territories should include at least some of the coverage stripped during leave (Houston, upstate NY) to demonstrate the restoration is genuine and not a token gesture. Document the restoration with a contemporaneous memo explaining the business rationale (e.g., rebalancing coverage loads across the team to improve efficiency, expanding the employee's geographic reach to align with product opportunities).

**Option B: Adjust revenue target proportionally.** If coverage is not restored, reduce the 2026 revenue target to reflect the employee's actual coverage universe relative to peers. The fairest calculation:

| Team Member | Firms | % of Total Team Firms | Proportional Share of $175k Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| A (Employee) | 1,138 | 8.2% | ~$55,000-$65,000 |
| P | 2,529 | 18.3% | ~$120,000-$135,000 |
| E | 4,036 | 29.2% | ~$175,000-$195,000 |
| J (Johnston) | 6,099 | 44.2% | ~$260,000-$300,000 |

A proportional target for 1,138 firms would be approximately $55,000-$65,000, depending on the per-firm revenue assumptions. Even a target of $80,000-$90,000 (adjusted upward for the higher per-firm value of Connecticut financial services clients) would be more defensible than $175,000.

**Option C: Combination.** Restore some coverage AND adjust the target, landing somewhere between the two extremes.

**Why this matters legally:** The employee's support team has already framed the coverage-target combination as "engineered outcome" and "setup-to-fail." The employee himself predicted in January 2026: "they'll first do a pip where they'll say he needs to do A B C and then I'll say I didn't do a b c knowing nobody can." If the PIP requires output that is mathematically unachievable given the employee's coverage, his prediction becomes an exhibit at trial. A plaintiff's attorney will show the jury two numbers -- 1,138 firms and $175,000 -- and then show them one comparator: 6,099 firms. The PIP will be dead on arrival.

### 1.2 Timing: Distance From Leave Return

The employee returned from his second parental leave on December 28, 2025. His year-end evaluation was delivered on February 17, 2026. As of this writing (February 20, 2026), the employee has been back for approximately 8 weeks.

**Minimum safe timing for a PIP: No earlier than May 2026.** Rationale:

- Implementing a PIP within 90 days of return from protected leave (i.e., before late March) creates an extremely strong temporal proximity inference. Under NYCHRL's "motivating factor" standard, temporal proximity alone can support retaliation claims. A PIP in March would be roughly 60 days after return -- the timing equivalent of an admission.
- The year-end evaluation (Feb 17) serves as the documented performance feedback that precedes the PIP. The employee needs a documented opportunity to respond to that feedback and demonstrate improvement. A PIP implemented immediately after the evaluation denies that opportunity.
- The March follow-up meeting (approximately March 5-10) should be used to set specific interim expectations. If the employee fails to meet those interim expectations by late April or May, the PIP has a documented basis beyond the initial evaluation.

**Ideal timing: June-July 2026 at the earliest,** preceded by at least two documented checkpoint meetings (March and May) where specific expectations were communicated, support was offered, and performance against those expectations was assessed.

### 1.3 Documentation Baseline

Before implementing a PIP, the following documentation trail must exist:

1. **The February 2026 year-end evaluation** (exists). This provides the initial performance feedback.

2. **A written set of 2026 expectations** shared with the employee. These must be specific and measurable. The year-end evaluation's Looking Forward section is too vague ("focus on developing and closing new business opportunities across all product lines") to serve as a PIP predicate. The employee needs to have received a document that says "here is what you need to accomplish in Q1/Q2 2026, measured by these specific metrics." Sharing this with the employee during or after the March meeting creates the baseline.

3. **At least one documented interim checkpoint** (the March meeting) where the employee's progress against the expectations was reviewed, any shortfalls were identified specifically, and additional support was offered. This checkpoint must be documented in writing (an email summary from the manager or HR, not just a verbal conversation).

4. **A second documented checkpoint** (approximately May) showing continued shortfalls. This is the trigger point: the employee was given feedback (Feb), given specific expectations (March), given time and support, checked in on (May), and still fell short. The PIP follows from this documented sequence.

5. **Evidence that the same documentation cadence exists for other team members.** If the employee is the only person receiving documented checkpoint meetings and written expectations, the process itself is evidence of targeting. At minimum, the March and May checkpoint structure should be offered to or conducted with one or more peers.

### 1.4 Progressive Discipline: The PIP Cannot Be Step One

A defensible PIP is never the first step. The disciplinary progression must be:

1. **Feedback** (the evaluation -- completed Feb 17)
2. **Specific expectations** (to be completed at the March meeting)
3. **Support and coaching** (ongoing between March and the next checkpoint)
4. **Documented interim check-in** (approximately May)
5. **Warning that PIP is being considered** (may occur at the May checkpoint if warranted)
6. **PIP implementation** (June-July at earliest, if performance has not improved)

If the manager jumps from step 1 (evaluation) to step 6 (PIP), the employee's legal team will argue there was no genuine attempt to help the employee improve. The PIP was a predetermined conclusion, not a response to continued underperformance after receiving support.

### 1.5 HR Must Be Fully Engaged

HR must review and approve the PIP before delivery. HR involvement serves multiple purposes:

- It demonstrates the PIP was not a unilateral decision by a manager with alleged retaliatory animus
- It ensures the PIP meets Bloomberg's internal standards and legal requirements
- It creates a second institutional actor who reviewed the employee's performance and agreed a PIP was warranted
- It provides a witness to the process who is not the manager

HR should also review the coverage disparity data and the target. If HR signs off on a PIP with a $175,000 target and 1,138 firms while a peer has 6,099 firms and the same target, HR becomes complicit in the setup-to-fail narrative and the company loses the "one bad manager" defense.

## Section 2: The Model PIP

**This PIP should only be implemented after all prerequisites in Section 1 are met.** It is designed to be genuinely achievable for someone with 1,138 firms in the Connecticut corridor, with targets calibrated to the employee's actual resources, not the team average.

### 2.0 PIP Preamble

The PIP document itself should open with the following elements:

- **Statement of purpose:** "This Performance Improvement Plan is designed to provide [Employee] with specific goals, clear timelines, and dedicated support to address performance areas identified in the 2025 year-end evaluation and subsequent checkpoint meetings."
- **Acknowledgment of the employee's history:** "We recognize [Employee]'s 13+ years of service and historical contributions to the team." This is not a courtesy; it prevents the defense from later pretending the employee has always been a marginal performer.
- **Reference to the documented feedback trail:** Cite the evaluation date, the specific expectations shared at the March meeting, and the checkpoint meeting where continued shortfalls were identified.

### 2.1 Objective 1: Revenue Generation

**Metric:** Total revenue booked from GDSF forecasts within the PIP period.

**Target:** $45,000 in new bookable revenue over the 90-day PIP period.

**Justification:** The employee's 2026 annual target is $175,000. However, this target has not been adjusted for coverage disparity, and the company should be prepared to justify whatever target is in effect at PIP implementation. A $45,000 quarterly target corresponds to an annualized pace of $180,000, which is in range of the $175,000 target. If the target has been adjusted downward per Section 1.1, the PIP quarterly target should be set at 25-30% of the adjusted annual target.

Critical note: If coverage has NOT been equalized by PIP implementation, the revenue target must be reduced proportionally. At 1,138 firms with a $175,000 annual target, a quarterly pace target above $25,000-$30,000 becomes increasingly difficult to defend as genuinely achievable relative to peers.

**How it's measured:** Revenue credited to the employee in Bloomberg's GDSF tracking system. This is an objective, system-generated metric that neither the employee nor the manager can manipulate.

**Peer benchmark:** The company must be prepared to produce the quarterly revenue pace for all team members during the same 90-day period. If any peer with substantially more coverage fails to meet this proportional target, the employee's failure becomes difficult to characterize as individual underperformance.

| Scenario | Employee's Coverage | PIP Revenue Target (90 days) | Implied Annual Pace | Defensibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage not restored, target not adjusted | 1,138 firms | $43,750 (25% of $175k) | $175,000 | Weak. $153.78/firm annualized while peers need $28-69/firm. |
| Target adjusted to $90,000 | 1,138 firms | $22,500 (25% of $90k) | $90,000 | Moderate. $79.09/firm. Still higher than peers but defensible as CT premium. |
| Coverage restored to ~2,500 firms | ~2,500 firms | $43,750 (25% of $175k) | $175,000 | Strong. $70/firm, comparable to peer P at 2,529 firms. |

**Recommended target:** If coverage is restored to ~2,500 firms: $40,000-$45,000 for the 90-day period. If coverage remains at 1,138 firms: no more than $20,000-$25,000.

### 2.2 Objective 2: New Client Onboards (EMSX/RBLD/RFQE)

**Metric:** Number of new client onboards across EMSX, RBLD, and RFQE product lines during the PIP period.

**Target:** 3 new client onboards in 90 days, with at least 1 reaching a bookable event (a forecast or first trade).

**Justification:** The year-end evaluation criticized the employee for having only 3 RFQE onboards at PartnerRe and Mariner that "did not lead to any bookable events in 2025." However, the Mariner RFQE onboard did result in a trade on August 25, 2025, and $31,600 in revenue closed January 5, 2026 (documented in the employee's counter-metrics file, though the manager's evaluation did not acknowledge this). Setting a target of 3 onboards with 1 reaching bookable status is consistent with or slightly below the employee's demonstrated pace in H1 2025, making it achievable.

**How it's measured:** Onboard completions tracked in Bloomberg's internal systems (the same systems used to track product adoption). Bookable event status is confirmed when a GDSF forecast is created or a first trade occurs.

**Peer benchmark:** The company must know how many onboards each peer completed in the same 90-day period. If the employee meets this target but a peer with 3-5x the coverage does not onboard proportionally more, the target is validated as reasonable.

### 2.3 Objective 3: Client Activity and Coverage Breadth

**Metric:** Two sub-metrics.

**(a) C-day activity:** Number of C days (client-visit days) in the primary Connecticut territory, with a minimum number of in-person meetings and unique accounts visited per C day.

**Target (a):** A minimum of 6 C days in CT during the 90-day period, averaging at least 5 in-person meetings per C day across at least 3 unique accounts per C day.

**Justification:** The year-end evaluation specifically cited "11 C days... 45 in-person meetings at a total of 18 accounts" in CT over approximately 6 months. That translates to approximately 1.8 C days per month, 4.1 meetings per C day, and 1.6 accounts per C day. The PIP target of 6 C days in 90 days (2 per month) with 5 meetings and 3 accounts per day represents a modest increase over the employee's documented H1 2025 pace in CT, not an unrealistic leap. It also addresses the evaluation's specific criticism about "not seeing enough clients while on C days" and days that "begin at 10am and end before market close."

**(b) Total client engagement:** Number of unique firms engaged (call, visit, or demo) during the PIP period.

**Target (b):** 85 unique firms engaged over 90 days.

**Justification:** The employee's H1 2025 data shows 177 unique firms engaged over approximately 6 months (~130 active working days, excluding weekends), which is approximately 29.5 unique firms per month or roughly 88 per quarter. Setting the target at 85 is essentially asking the employee to maintain his demonstrated H1 2025 pace, which his own data shows he led the team on. This target is therefore provably achievable -- the employee himself already achieved it. Any challenge to this target must contend with the employee's own counter-metric of 177 firms in 6 months.

**How it's measured:**
- C days and in-person meetings: Bloomberg's internal activity tracking system (the same system that generated the evaluation's CT data).
- Unique firms engaged: Bloomberg's CRM or activity logging system, the same tool that produced the 177-firm count the employee claims.

**Peer benchmark:** Request the same data for all peers. If a peer with 5.4x the coverage engages fewer than 5.4x the unique firms, the employee's relative effort is further validated.

### 2.4 Objective 4: Strategic Campaign Adoption

**Metric:** Number of sustained strategic campaign adoptions (client workflows initiated through Bloomberg campaigns that result in continued use beyond the initial interaction).

**Target:** 2 sustained adoptions during the PIP period. "Sustained" means the client uses the workflow at least 3 times within 30 days of initial adoption (not just a single trial).

**Justification:** The evaluation credited the employee with 3 adoptions but noted they were "generous as the users only tried the workflows once each and have not actually adopted." The PIP addresses this directly by requiring sustained use, not just initial trial. The target of 2 sustained adoptions is lower than the 3 credited in H1 2025, acknowledging that sustained adoption is harder to achieve than initial trial. This makes the target genuinely more achievable than it appears at first glance.

**How it's measured:** Bloomberg's internal campaign tracking system. Adoption events and subsequent usage frequency are system-recorded. The "3 uses in 30 days" threshold can be verified against system logs.

**Peer benchmark:** What sustained adoption rates do peers achieve? If the standard metric for the team is initial trial (not sustained use), imposing a higher standard on this employee is evidence of disparate treatment. The definition of "adoption" used in the PIP must match the definition used in evaluations and PIP criteria for all team members.

### 2.5 Objective 5: Pipeline Development

**Metric:** Active pipeline value in GDSF at the end of the PIP period.

**Target:** $60,000 in active pipeline (forecasts in development stages, not yet booked).

**Justification:** The evaluation criticized "pipeline development" as an area of underperformance. The employee's H1 2025 pipeline included Two Seas ($53,800, which booked during leave) and several RFQE opportunities. A $60,000 pipeline target over 90 days represents a realistic development pace for someone working a Connecticut territory of 1,138 firms. It is also directionally consistent with the employee's demonstrated ability to generate $80,100 in bookable revenue over 6 months.

**How it's measured:** Pipeline value as recorded in Bloomberg's GDSF system. Pipeline stages and values are system-documented.

**Peer benchmark:** All peers' pipeline values at the same measurement point. Pipeline is a function of coverage breadth, so peer comparisons must account for coverage size.

### 2.6 Timeline

**Total duration: 90 calendar days.** A PIP shorter than 90 days (e.g., 30 or 45 days) is a red flag for pretext. Thirty-day PIPs are widely characterized by employment attorneys as "designed to fail" because they do not provide a genuine opportunity for improvement. Ninety days is the standard threshold for defensibility and is Bloomberg's likely standard.

**Checkpoint schedule:**

| Day | Event | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | PIP delivered | Employee receives PIP with all objectives, timeline, and support plan. HR present. |
| 14 | First check-in | Review initial activity. Identify any obstacles. Offer additional support. Document in writing. |
| 30 | First formal checkpoint | Review progress against all 5 objectives. Written assessment from manager. Employee opportunity to provide input. |
| 60 | Second formal checkpoint | Review progress against all 5 objectives. Written assessment. If significant improvement shown, document it. If shortfalls remain, identify specific gaps and offer targeted support. |
| 90 | Final assessment | Formal review against all objectives. Pass/fail determination. |

### 2.7 Support and Resources

The more support the company provides, the harder it becomes to claim the PIP was designed to fail. Each support element must be documented.

| Support Element | Description | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **Manager coaching sessions** | Bi-weekly 30-minute 1-on-1s focused on pipeline strategy, client prioritization, and campaign execution. These are in addition to normal team meetings. | Calendar invites + brief written summary of each session's discussion and agreed-upon action items. |
| **Coverage review** | If coverage has not been equalized, the company should offer the employee first priority on any new coverage that becomes available during the PIP period. This demonstrates good faith. | Written offer documented in PIP or checkpoint notes. |
| **Product training** | Access to any Bloomberg product training relevant to EMSX, RBLD, RFQE, and current campaigns. If the company offers sales enablement sessions, the employee should be explicitly invited. | Training enrollment records. |
| **Client introduction support** | For new accounts in the employee's territory, the manager or a peer should offer to make introductions or participate in initial meetings. This addresses the "cast a wider net" criticism from the evaluation. | Documented offers in checkpoint notes. If the employee declines assistance, document that too. |
| **CRM/pipeline tools** | Access to any pipeline management, campaign tracking, or client analytics tools available to the team. Confirm the employee has the same toolset as peers. | Written confirmation from IT or sales operations. |

**Why this matters:** If the employee's attorney asks "What did the company do to help him succeed on the PIP?" the answer must be substantive, documented, and specific. "We offered coaching, training, and client support" is a good answer. "We gave him 90 days and told him to do better" is a bad one.

### 2.8 Documentation Requirements During the PIP

| What | Who | How Often | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| Activity metrics (visits, firms engaged, interactions) | System-generated | Pulled at each checkpoint | Bloomberg system reports |
| Revenue and pipeline data | System-generated | Pulled at each checkpoint | GDSF reports |
| Campaign adoption data | System-generated | Pulled at each checkpoint | Campaign tracking system |
| Checkpoint meeting notes | Manager, reviewed by HR | At each checkpoint (Days 14, 30, 60, 90) | Written memo, signed by manager and HR, copy to employee |
| Employee self-assessment | Employee | At each formal checkpoint (Days 30, 60, 90) | Written input from the employee on his own progress, obstacles, and support requests |
| Support provided | Manager | Ongoing | Log of coaching sessions, training offered, introductions made |

**Critical rule:** Document both successes and failures. If the employee improves on one metric but not another, the checkpoint notes must reflect the improvement. An exclusively negative documentation trail is evidence of bad faith. If the employee is genuinely trying and making partial progress, acknowledge it in writing. The PIP is supposed to help the employee succeed, and the documentation should reflect that intent.

### 2.9 Success Criteria

**The employee passes the PIP if he meets the following:**

| Objective | Target | Measurement | Pass Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $45,000 (adjusted if coverage not restored; see 2.1) | GDSF bookable forecasts | Met or exceeded |
| New onboards | 3 onboards, 1 bookable | System-tracked onboard completions | Met or exceeded |
| CT C-day activity | 6 C days, avg 5 meetings/3 accounts per day | Activity tracking system | Met or exceeded |
| Unique firms engaged | 85 firms | CRM/activity system | Met or exceeded |
| Campaign adoptions | 2 sustained (3+ uses in 30 days) | Campaign tracking system | Met or exceeded |
| Pipeline | $60,000 active pipeline | GDSF pipeline report | Met or exceeded |

**Pass definition:** The employee must meet or exceed 4 of 6 objectives. This is deliberate. Requiring all 6 creates a "one miss and you're out" dynamic that courts view skeptically. Requiring 4 of 6 demonstrates the PIP is designed for improvement, not for failure. It also gives the company flexibility: if the employee meets 3 of 6, it is a genuine miss that can be documented. If the employee meets 5 of 6, success is clear.

**What happens if the employee passes:** The PIP is lifted. The employee returns to standard evaluation processes. Document the successful completion. This is the most important outcome for the defense: it proves the PIP was genuine and the employee was given a real chance to succeed.

**What happens if the employee fails:** The company proceeds to the next disciplinary step (extended PIP, reassignment, or separation), depending on the nature and degree of the shortfall. The specific next step should be determined in consultation with HR and employment counsel, not solely by the manager.

---

## Section 3: Attack Analysis

For every element of the PIP above, the employee's legal team will mount specific challenges. Each attack is analyzed below with the corresponding defense.

### 3.1 Attack: "The PIP is pretextual -- it follows coverage stripping"

**The argument:** The manager stripped the employee's coverage (Houston, upstate NY removed during first leave, never restored; excluded from Baptist redistribution; CT lead reassigned), reducing his client universe to the lowest on the team. The manager then evaluated him against peers with 2-5x the coverage, and now proposes a PIP based on that tainted evaluation. The PIP is the third step in a strip-evaluate-PIP playbook identical to what Sam Page experienced.

**Vulnerability:** This is the strongest attack. The coverage-target mismatch is quantified, objective, and from Bloomberg's own data. A jury will understand intuitively that you cannot strip someone's territory and then fire them for not selling enough.

**Armor:**
- Coverage must be restored or targets adjusted before PIP implementation (Section 1.1). This is non-negotiable. Without this step, the attack is unanswerable.
- If coverage is restored, the PIP response becomes: "We heard the employee's concern about coverage. We restored it. We gave him resources comparable to his peers. We set targets proportional to those resources. The PIP was implemented only after the playing field was leveled." This is a strong narrative.
- Document the coverage restoration with a contemporaneous business rationale that does not reference the employee's complaints, leave status, or legal risk.

### 3.2 Attack: "The targets are set to be unachievable"

**The argument:** The employee's own January 2026 prediction: "they'll first do a pip where they'll say he needs to do A B C and then I'll say I didn't do a b c knowing nobody can." If the PIP targets exceed what the employee can reasonably produce with his current resources -- or exceed what his peers produce with substantially more resources -- the targets prove the prediction correct.

**Vulnerability:** Medium-high. The employee anticipated this exact scenario and documented it. If the PIP targets are aggressive, this WhatsApp message becomes Exhibit A.

**Armor:**
- Every PIP target in Section 2 is calibrated to the employee's own demonstrated performance in H1 2025 or to a modest increment above it. The client activity target (85 unique firms) is actually below his demonstrated pace (177 in ~6 months = ~88 per quarter). The C-day target (6 in 90 days) is only a modest increase from his pace (11 in ~6 months = ~5.5 per quarter). These targets can be defended as "we're asking him to maintain the level he already demonstrated."
- Revenue targets must be proportional to coverage. This is the one area where achievability depends entirely on the coverage decision. See 2.1.
- Produce peer performance data for the same period showing that the targets are at or below what peers achieve. If a peer with 2,529 firms books $50,000 in a quarter, asking the employee to book $45,000 with comparable coverage is defensible.

### 3.3 Attack: "The PIP was implemented too soon after leave return"

**The argument:** The employee returned December 28, 2025. The evaluation came February 17. Under any timeline, a PIP lands within months of return from protected leave. FMLA, PFL, and NYCHRL all prohibit retaliation for exercising leave rights, and temporal proximity is strong evidence of retaliation.

**Vulnerability:** Medium. Temporal proximity is a factor but not dispositive. The question is whether the company can show an intervening period of documented performance concerns, genuine coaching, and opportunity to improve.

**Armor:**
- The preliminary requirements in Section 1 create a 4-5 month buffer between leave return (Dec 28) and earliest PIP implementation (May-July 2026). This is not a 30-day rush job.
- The intervening period includes: feedback (Feb evaluation), specific expectations set (March meeting), coaching and support (March-May), documented checkpoint (May), PIP warning (May if warranted), and PIP implementation (June-July). Each step is documented and provides the employee an opportunity to improve.
- If the employee does improve during the March-May period, the PIP is not implemented. This is the strongest defense: the process was genuine, and if the employee had improved, there would have been no PIP.

### 3.4 Attack: "Peers with similar metrics are not on PIPs -- selective application"

**The argument:** If any peer fails to meet the same metrics at the same proportional rate and is not on a PIP, the employee is being singled out.

**Vulnerability:** High. This is a comparator-based attack that requires only one example to be effective. If any team member underperforms on any metric without facing a PIP or equivalent accountability, the employee's PIP looks targeted.

**Armor:**
- The PIP criteria (Section 2) are drawn from the standard metrics Bloomberg uses to evaluate all team members: revenue, onboards, C-day activity, campaign adoption, pipeline. These are not custom metrics invented for this employee.
- Before implementing the PIP, audit every team member's performance against the same criteria. If any peer is also underperforming, they should receive documented feedback, coaching, or their own PIP. Consistency is the only defense against selective application.
- If all peers are performing adequately on these metrics, the employee is genuinely the underperformer, and the PIP is justified.
- Produce documentation showing these same metrics are used in evaluations for all team members across cycles.

### 3.5 Attack: "The manager controls the inputs -- circular logic"

**The argument:** The manager assigns coverage (input). The manager evaluates revenue and activity (output). The manager proposes the PIP (consequence). One person controls the entire chain. He can make anyone fail by adjusting the inputs, then discipline them for the resulting outputs. This is not performance management; it is engineering a predetermined outcome.

**Vulnerability:** High. This is a structural argument that resonates with juries because it is logically sound. When the same person controls both the inputs and evaluates the outputs, the system has no check on pretextual manipulation.

**Armor:**
- HR involvement in the PIP breaks the single-manager chain. HR reviews the coverage, the targets, the evaluation, and the PIP criteria. HR signs off on the PIP and participates in checkpoints. This introduces an institutional check that the employee's argument ignores.
- Coverage restoration (Section 1.1) addresses the input manipulation directly: the employee's coverage is equalized, removing the manager's ability to engineer failure through territory decisions.
- System-generated metrics (revenue in GDSF, activity in CRM) provide objective measurement that the manager cannot manipulate. The data is what the data is.
- If feasible, have a second manager or HR representative co-administer the PIP checkpoints. This removes the single-manager bottleneck.

### 3.6 Attack: "Sam Page went through this exact sequence -- and Sabrina confirms the pattern" *(Updated Feb 21)*

**The argument:** Sam Page allegedly experienced: leave, coverage stripped, negative evaluation, PIP, pushed out. The employee is now experiencing: leave, coverage stripped, negative evaluation, PIP threatened. The PIP would complete the pattern and prove the playbook.

**Feb 21 update -- Sabrina as third data point:** Sabrina Sparapani's iMessage evidence now provides a third employee who characterizes her experience under the same manager as the "same playbook." While Sabrina's situation may differ (she resigned rather than being PIPed), her testimony that the manager retaliates against leave-takers reinforces the pattern argument. The employee's Monday attorney script will present this as a three-victim pattern (Sasha, Sabrina, Sam Page) to intake calls. Whether all three formally cooperate is uncertain, but the narrative compounds.

**Vulnerability:** If Sam Page cooperates, this is devastating. If Sabrina also cooperates formally, the defense faces three alleged victims under one manager -- at which point the PIP is not just evidence in Sasha's case but evidence that the manager has a systemic practice. This is the nuclear scenario for the defense. Even if Sabrina's formal cooperation is uncertain, her iMessage statements are in the employee's possession and will be presented to attorneys.

**Armor:**
- Investigate Sam Page's file immediately (recommended in DEFENSE_STRATEGY.md). If Page's PIP was well-documented, based on genuine performance deficiencies, and Page was given real support and opportunity, the parallel weakens.
- If Page's PIP was poorly documented or looks pretextual in retrospect, the company should strongly consider NOT implementing a PIP for this employee. See Section 6.
- For Sabrina: review her employment file to determine whether her treatment was legitimate performance management or whether it mirrors the alleged pattern. If her file shows documented performance issues unrelated to leave, her "same playbook" characterization can be challenged.
- Any PIP implemented for this employee must differ from Page's PIP in structure, criteria, timeline, and support. If the two PIPs are structurally similar (same metrics, same timeline, same outcome), the pattern argument writes itself. This is one reason the PIP in Section 2 includes extensive support provisions, a 4-of-6 pass threshold, and employee self-assessment opportunities -- features that presumably did not exist in Page's PIP.

### 3.7 Attack: "The success criteria use metrics that the manager can subjectively interpret"

**The argument:** Metrics like "sustained adoption" (who defines sustained?), "active pipeline" (manager controls pipeline visibility), and "breadth of coverage" are vague enough for the manager to declare failure regardless of the employee's effort.

**Vulnerability:** Low-medium, if the PIP is designed correctly.

**Armor:**
- Every metric in Section 2 is tied to a specific, system-generated measurement with a numerical threshold. Revenue is in GDSF. Onboards are system-tracked. C days and meetings are in the activity system. Campaign adoption is tracked with a defined threshold (3+ uses in 30 days). Pipeline is in GDSF.
- The manager cannot "declare" failure on metrics that are system-measured. The numbers either meet the threshold or they do not.
- The employee's self-assessment at each checkpoint creates an additional record. If the employee believes he is meeting targets and the manager disagrees, the dispute will be visible in the documentation rather than being a post-hoc reconstruction.

### 3.8 Attack: "The evaluation that triggered the PIP is itself retaliatory"

**The argument:** The PIP rests on the year-end evaluation. The evaluation compared half-year data to full-year peers, explicitly referenced parental leave as the reason the employee couldn't improve, and ignored the employee's actual activity metrics (highest on team). If the evaluation is tainted, the PIP inherits the taint.

**Vulnerability:** High. This is the foundational attack. If the evaluation is pretextual, everything built on it is pretextual.

**Armor:**
- The PIP cannot rely solely on the year-end evaluation. It must be justified by documented performance data from the period after the evaluation: the March meeting expectations, the May checkpoint data, and the employee's actual Q1/Q2 2026 performance. The evaluation is the starting point, but the PIP's justification must be grounded in post-evaluation performance.
- If the employee's Q1/Q2 2026 performance is strong -- activity metrics remain high, revenue comes in, pipeline develops -- the PIP should not be implemented, period. Implementing a PIP against an employee who is clearly performing undermines the entire defense.
- If the employee's Q1/Q2 2026 performance genuinely lags, document it with system data, compare it to peers, and use that data as the PIP basis. The evaluation becomes background; the current performance is foreground.

## Section 4: Timing and Sequencing

### 4.1 The March Follow-Up Meeting (~March 5-10, 2026)

The employee proactively scheduled this meeting. This is the single most important event between now and any PIP implementation.

**What the manager should do at this meeting:**

1. Discuss specific, measurable expectations for Q1/Q2 2026. Put them in writing before or after the meeting (not as a formal PIP, but as a normal goal-setting exercise).
2. Address coverage if the employee raises it. The employee's support team is coaching him to request coverage restoration. The manager's response creates evidence either way: restoring coverage helps the defense; refusing without justification helps the plaintiff.
3. Confirm the employee is not on a PIP. The evaluation already says this, but verbal confirmation at the meeting, documented in a follow-up email, strengthens the defense.
4. Offer support. "What do you need to succeed in Q1?" is both good management and good litigation preparation.
5. Do NOT reference parental leave, time away, return from leave, or any related topic.

**What the manager should document after this meeting:**

A brief email to the employee (and HR if possible) summarizing the key points discussed: the specific goals for Q1/Q2, any coverage decisions, support offered, and the next check-in date. This email becomes the baseline for the PIP predicate.

### 4.2 Sequencing Timeline

| Date | Event | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 17, 2026 | Year-end evaluation delivered | Feedback provided. Leave-related language is a vulnerability. |
| ~Mar 5-10, 2026 | Follow-up meeting | Set specific Q1/Q2 expectations. Discuss coverage. Offer support. Document. |
| ~Apr 2026 | Informal check-in | Brief touchpoint. How is the employee tracking? Any obstacles? Low-key documentation. |
| ~May 2026 | Formal checkpoint | Review Q1 performance against March expectations. Written assessment. If shortfalls, document them specifically. If improvement, document that. Discuss PIP possibility only if performance is clearly and documentably below expectations. |
| May-Jun 2026 | Coverage restoration (if not done earlier) | If not done at or before the March meeting, this must happen before any PIP. |
| Jun-Jul 2026 (earliest) | PIP implementation (if warranted) | Only if: (a) coverage equalized or targets adjusted, (b) documented interim shortfalls exist, (c) support was offered and taken/declined, (d) HR has reviewed and approved. |
| Jul-Oct 2026 | PIP period (90 days) | Checkpoints at Days 14, 30, 60, 90. |
| Oct 2026 | PIP outcome determined | Pass or fail based on documented, system-verified metrics. |

### 4.3 Prerequisites That Must Be Met Before Implementation

Before the PIP is delivered, the following must be true:

- [ ] Coverage has been equalized to at least 2,000+ firms, OR the revenue target has been adjusted proportionally
- [ ] The employee received specific, written Q1/Q2 expectations at or after the March meeting
- [ ] At least one documented interim checkpoint (May) has occurred
- [ ] The employee's Q1/Q2 performance data from Bloomberg's systems has been pulled and shows measurable shortfalls against the March expectations
- [ ] Peer performance data for the same period has been pulled, confirming the employee's performance is below peers on the relevant metrics
- [ ] HR has reviewed the PIP document, the supporting data, and the coverage situation
- [ ] The PIP criteria use the same metrics applied to all team members in evaluations
- [ ] The PIP has been reviewed by employment counsel
- [ ] The Sam Page file has been reviewed and the PIP design accounts for any pattern-evidence risk
- [ ] The employee has been offered support (coaching, training, coverage review) and his acceptance or declination has been documented

## Section 5: What NOT to Do

These are common PIP mistakes that create legal liability, each analyzed for why it is dangerous in this specific case.

### 5.1 Do Not Set Targets the Employee Cannot Meet With Current Resources

**Why it's dangerous here:** The coverage disparity is quantified. A PIP with a $175,000 annualized revenue target for 1,138 firms when a peer needs the same target for 6,099 firms is a mathematical exhibit for the plaintiff. The employee predicted this. The employee's support team calls it an "engineered outcome." If the PIP proves the prediction, the case is substantially strengthened.

### 5.2 Do Not Use Metrics That Peers Also Fail to Meet

**Why it's dangerous here:** The employee claims he led the team in client activity (648 interactions, 178 visits, 177 unique firms in H1 2025). If the PIP includes activity metrics and the employee meets them while a peer does not -- and the peer faces no consequences -- the selective application argument is airtight.

**Prevention:** Before setting any metric in the PIP, pull current peer data. Every metric must be one where the employee is genuinely underperforming relative to peers, not one where the employee is actually at or above peer levels.

### 5.3 Do Not Implement Within 90 Days of Return From Protected Leave Without Documented Interim Feedback

**Why it's dangerous here:** The employee returned December 28, 2025. Implementing a PIP before late March 2026 creates a direct temporal proximity argument. Under NYCHRL's "motivating factor" standard, a PIP delivered within weeks of leave return, without documented interim feedback showing the employee was given a chance to improve, will be treated as retaliation.

**Prevention:** Follow the Section 4 timeline. The earliest defensible PIP implementation is June 2026, after the March expectations, April check-in, and May checkpoint have occurred.

### 5.4 Do Not Fail to Provide the Stated Support

**Why it's dangerous here:** If the PIP promises bi-weekly coaching sessions and the manager cancels three of them, the employee's attorney will argue the PIP was not genuine. If the PIP promises coverage review and no coverage is offered, same result.

**Prevention:** Every support element in Section 2.7 must actually be provided. Document each coaching session, each training opportunity, each introduction offered. If the employee declines support, document the declination. The support log is as important as the performance data.

### 5.5 Do Not Document Only Failures and Ignore Improvements

**Why it's dangerous here:** The employee's support team will argue the PIP documentation was designed to build a termination file, not to track genuine performance. If the checkpoint notes contain only criticisms and no acknowledgment of improvement or effort, a jury will agree.

**Prevention:** Checkpoint notes must be balanced. If the employee's activity metrics improve but revenue lags, say so. If the employee is making more C-day visits but not yet converting pipeline, acknowledge the effort while noting the gap. Balanced documentation is the hallmark of genuine performance management. One-sided documentation is the hallmark of pretextual PIPs.

### 5.6 Do Not Change the Success Criteria Mid-PIP

**Why it's dangerous here:** If the employee starts meeting targets and the manager raises the bar, the PIP becomes a moving goalpost. The employee's January 2026 prediction ("they'll say he needs to do A B C and then I'll say I didn't do a b c knowing nobody can") specifically anticipates impossible or shifting criteria.

**Prevention:** The PIP targets in Section 2 are fixed at implementation. They do not change. If the company determines the targets were too low, the appropriate response is to acknowledge PIP success and set higher expectations for the next period -- not to change the PIP mid-stream.

### 5.7 Do Not Use Subjective Criteria That Cannot Be Independently Verified

**Why it's dangerous here:** Criteria like "demonstrate stronger commitment" or "show improved attitude" or "engage more productively with clients" are subjective, unverifiable, and controllable by the evaluating manager. The employee's attorney will argue the manager can declare failure on subjective criteria regardless of the employee's actual effort.

**Prevention:** Every criterion in Section 2 has a numerical target tied to a Bloomberg system-generated measurement. "Revenue booked: $45,000" is verifiable. "Show improvement" is not.

### 5.8 Do Not Let the Manager Be the Sole Evaluator

**Why it's dangerous here:** The employee's core claim is that this specific manager retaliates against employees who take parental leave. If the same manager is the sole evaluator of PIP success or failure, the employee's attorney will argue the outcome was predetermined. The manager's alleged animus infects his judgment.

**Prevention:** HR must co-evaluate PIP performance. A second manager or senior leader should review the checkpoint data and the final assessment. System-generated metrics provide an objective layer that does not depend on the manager's subjective judgment.

### 5.9 Do Not Implement a PIP That Mirrors Sam Page's PIP

**Why it's dangerous here:** If the PIP structure, metrics, timeline, and outcome resemble what Sam Page experienced, the pattern evidence is confirmed. "Same manager, same process, same result for every employee who takes full leave."

**Prevention:** Before finalizing the PIP, review Sam Page's PIP documentation. Identify structural elements that differ. The model PIP in Section 2 includes several features designed to distinguish it: a 4-of-6 pass threshold (not all-or-nothing), employee self-assessment opportunities, documented support with a coaching log, HR co-administration, and explicit coverage equalization. If Page's PIP had none of these, the differentiation is clear.

## Section 6: The Alternative -- Whether to PIP at All

This is the most important section of this document. The question is not "how do we build a defensible PIP." The question is whether implementing a PIP is strategically wise given the current landscape.

### 6.1 Factors Arguing Against a PIP *(Updated Feb 21)*

**The employee is actively pursuing legal counsel.** As of February 21, 2026, the employee has a fully operational attorney outreach playbook targeting five firms. Calls are scheduled for Monday, Feb 23. The target list now includes Wigdor LLP and Derek Smith Law Group in addition to the three previously identified. The employee will present Sabrina's evidence, the forecast tampering allegation, and a three-victim pattern narrative to attorneys on intake calls. If the employee retains counsel before a PIP is implemented, the PIP will be delivered into a situation where every word is being reviewed by a plaintiff's attorney. Any defect, any mismatch with peer treatment, any echo of the Sam Page pattern will be immediately weaponized.

**The employee predicted this exact move.** On January 5, 2026, in a WhatsApp group chat, the employee stated: "It's because they'll first do a pip where they'll say he needs to do A B C and then I'll say I didn't do a b c knowing nobody can." Implementing a PIP after the employee documented this prediction gives the plaintiff a compelling exhibit: the employee saw the playbook coming, and the company executed it anyway. A jury will read this as confirmation that the PIP was indeed a predetermined step in a managed-out process, not a genuine performance management tool.

**The pattern evidence has expanded beyond Sam Page.** *(Updated Feb 21)* Sam Page remains the most dangerous pattern comparator. But Sabrina Sparapani's iMessage evidence now provides a third data point. She characterizes her own experience under the same manager as the "same playbook" and states he "retaliates against people who go on leave especially men." Whether she formally cooperates is uncertain, but her statements are in the employee's possession. A PIP would give the plaintiff a sequence of three alleged victims: Page (leave-PIP-out), Sabrina (leave-"playbook"-resigned), Sasha (leave-PIP-?). The defense can no longer argue coincidence even if Sabrina's formal cooperation is uncertain.

**The forecast tampering allegation changes the calculus.** *(Added Feb 21)* If the CRM audit trail confirms the employee's account that the manager closed a ~$58K forecast as "dupe," stripped notes, and reopened it on 9/5/2025, implementing a PIP is reckless. The motive narrative -- suppressed his numbers, then rated him as underperforming, then PIPed him for underperforming -- is devastating. A PIP would be the capstone of an alleged scheme. **If the audit trail is problematic, do not PIP under any circumstances.** If the audit trail shows routine CRM maintenance, this factor is neutralized, but the other factors against a PIP remain.

**The coverage disparity means any PIP will be attacked as a setup-to-fail.** Even with coverage restoration (Section 1.1), the employee's team will argue that restoring coverage right before a PIP is itself suspicious -- "they gave him back his territory just so they could say the PIP was fair, but the damage from years of coverage stripping was already done." There is no clean path through this.

**The evaluation that would serve as the PIP's basis is itself vulnerable.** The mid-year evaluation acknowledges leave prevents improvement. The year-end evaluation compares half-year data to full-year peers without prorating. The employee has counter-metrics showing he led the team in activity. Every vulnerability in the evaluation transfers to the PIP.

**The "8 and 8" and "we didn't cut your pay" comments exist.** The manager has made multiple documented statements linking compensation and performance assessment to leave. Any PIP initiated by this manager carries the taint of those statements, regardless of how carefully the PIP is designed.

**Sabrina's HR exit interview may establish institutional knowledge.** *(Added Feb 21)* If Sabrina's exit interview notes contain specific complaints about the manager's treatment of leave-takers, and Bloomberg did nothing, a PIP implemented after institutional knowledge of the pattern compounds the company's exposure. The company knew about the alleged pattern (via Sabrina's complaints) and proceeded to execute the next step of the alleged playbook anyway.

### 6.2 Factors Arguing For a PIP

**The employee may genuinely be underperforming.** High activity does not necessarily equal effective selling. If the employee is making many calls and visits but not converting pipeline, not driving sustained adoption, and not developing new revenue opportunities, a PIP is a legitimate management tool. The evaluation cites specific qualitative deficiencies (strategic adoptions were trials not sustained, C-day productivity was low, days were short) that activity volume does not address.

**Not addressing underperformance creates its own risk.** If the manager identifies performance issues and does nothing, the company is exposed to claims from other team members that standards are not applied consistently. A manager who fails to manage underperformance is not doing his job. The employee's leave status does not make him immune from accountability for genuine performance deficiencies.

**A PIP that the employee passes is the strongest possible defense.** If the PIP is genuinely achievable, and the employee succeeds, the company has demonstrated: (a) the process was fair, (b) the criteria were achievable, (c) the employee was given support and resources, and (d) the company's intent was improvement, not termination. A passed PIP largely defeats the retaliation narrative.

**Doing nothing may embolden the employee's legal position.** If the company backs off performance management entirely because the employee is building a legal case, the message is that threatening litigation grants immunity from accountability. This creates a precedent problem beyond this one employee.

### 6.3 Alternative Approaches

**Option 1: Informal coaching plan (NOT called a PIP).**

Replace the formal PIP with a documented coaching engagement. The manager (and ideally a second leader or HR partner) works with the employee on specific goals, checks in regularly, and documents progress. This achieves performance management without the legal trigger of a formal PIP. The employee's support team is specifically watching for a "PIP" -- they may not frame an informal coaching plan the same way.

*Advantages:* Avoids the word "PIP" and the formal termination path it implies. Harder for the employee to characterize as the next step in a managed-out playbook. Demonstrates good-faith management. If the employee improves, success. If the employee does not improve, the documentation trail still supports escalation to a formal PIP or other action later.

*Disadvantages:* Less structured. The employee's attorney will argue it is a "shadow PIP" designed to avoid the legal scrutiny of a formal one. If the company later escalates to a formal PIP, the informal period becomes evidence that the company knew a formal PIP was risky and tried to work around it.

**Option 2: Coverage restoration with clear expectations (no PIP, no coaching plan).**

Restore the employee's coverage to a level comparable to peers. Set clear, written expectations for 2026. Monitor and document performance through normal evaluation cycles. If performance remains below expectations at the next evaluation cycle (year-end 2026), address it then -- with the coverage disparity argument fully neutralized.

*Advantages:* Removes the most dangerous piece of evidence (coverage disparity) from the case. Gives the employee a genuine opportunity to perform with adequate resources. If the employee still underperforms with equalized coverage, the company's position is dramatically stronger at the next evaluation. The six-month lag also creates temporal distance from the leave return.

*Disadvantages:* Delays accountability for potentially genuine underperformance. If the employee's performance is legitimately poor, 10 months of documented non-action (from the Feb evaluation to the Dec year-end) weakens the company's argument that it takes performance seriously.

**Option 3: Monitored observation with documentation.**

Take no formal action. Monitor the employee's performance through normal channels. Document everything objectively. Pull system-generated metrics monthly. If the employee's Q1/Q2 2026 performance is genuinely subpar, the data will speak for itself and provide a much stronger PIP basis than the 2025 evaluation does. If the employee's performance is adequate or strong, no PIP is warranted and the company avoids an unnecessary legal fight.

*Advantages:* Lowest legal risk. The employee cannot claim a PIP is retaliatory if no PIP is implemented. The March meeting and normal check-ins still create a coaching dynamic. System-generated data from Q1/Q2 2026 will be the most powerful evidence in the company's arsenal -- far stronger than the half-year-compared-to-full-year data from the 2025 evaluation.

*Disadvantages:* No formal accountability mechanism. If the employee is building a case, the absence of a PIP does not stop the lawsuit. The employee's claims are based on the evaluations, coverage stripping, and manager statements -- none of which require a PIP to be actionable. The PIP, if it existed and the employee failed it, would actually provide the company with a performance-based justification for any eventual separation.

### 6.4 Recommendation *(Updated Feb 21)*

**Do not implement a formal PIP before Q3 2026 at the earliest -- and possibly not at all if the forecast tampering allegation is confirmed. Pursue Option 2 (coverage restoration with clear expectations) as the primary approach, combined with elements of Option 3 (monitored observation with documentation).**

**Rationale:**

1. **The coverage disparity must be resolved regardless of whether a PIP is implemented.** It is the single most dangerous factual element in the case. Restoring coverage is the highest-value defensive action available. It should happen at the March meeting or shortly thereafter.

2. **Q1/Q2 2026 performance data is the key asset.** If the employee performs well with restored coverage, the company's best outcome is an employee who is productive and whose legal claims are weakened by positive performance. If the employee performs poorly with restored coverage, the company has an unimpeachable basis for a PIP: "We gave him the resources, the support, and the time. He still underperformed. Here is the data."

3. **The Sam Page investigation must conclude before any PIP.** If Page's file reveals a pattern that is genuinely damaging, implementing a PIP is reckless. If Page's file supports legitimate performance management, the risk is substantially reduced.

4. *(Added Feb 21)* **The CRM audit trail must be resolved before any PIP.** If the forecast tampering allegation is confirmed by the audit trail, a PIP is off the table entirely. The motive narrative (suppress numbers -> rate as underperforming -> PIP for underperforming) would be irrefutable. Even if the audit trail is clean, the fact that the allegation exists and will be presented to attorneys means the PIP must be bulletproof on every other dimension.

5. *(Added Feb 21)* **Sabrina's evidence and HR exit interview notes should be reviewed before any PIP.** If the HR exit interview notes contain specific complaints about the manager's treatment of leave-takers, implementing a PIP after the company had institutional knowledge of the alleged pattern is significantly more risky. The company knew -- and did the thing the departing employee warned them about.

6. **The employee's attorney status must be known.** If the employee retains Outten & Golden or Cohen Milstein, a PIP should be reviewed by those firms' track record and litigation approach before implementation. Defense counsel should assess the specific risk.

7. **Time favors the defense on this specific issue.** The longer the gap between leave return and PIP, the weaker the temporal proximity argument. Every month that passes without a PIP reduces the retaliation inference. If the PIP must come, it is far better at month 6 than month 3.

**If a PIP becomes necessary after Q3 2026,** it should follow the model in Section 2, with every prerequisite in Section 1 met, every attack in Section 3 armored against, and every prohibition in Section 5 observed. The PIP should be co-administered by HR, use system-generated metrics that the manager cannot manipulate, and include genuine support provisions that are actually provided and documented.

**If the CRM audit trail confirms the forecast tampering allegation,** a formal PIP should not be implemented under any timeline. The company's strategic posture should shift entirely to settlement preparation (see LITIGATION_PREP.md Section 7). The manager's position within the company becomes a separate question that Bloomberg will need to address independently of the employee's case.

**The manager's goal should be:** "I want this employee to succeed. I gave him resources, set clear expectations, provided support, and documented everything. If he still can't perform, I have a clear, honest, data-driven basis for next steps." A jury that hears this story will be far less sympathetic to the employee than a jury that hears: "The manager stripped his territory, gave him a bad review for being on leave, and then put him on a PIP that no one could pass."

## Appendix: Key Data Points for PIP Calibration

These are the employee's own claimed metrics from H1 2025, sourced from `Employee_Counter_Metrics_2025.md`. They represent the floor for PIP targets because the employee's own legal team will cite them as evidence of strong performance. Any PIP target below these levels cannot be attacked as unachievable. Any PIP target substantially above these levels requires justification for why the increase is warranted.

| Metric | Employee's H1 2025 Claim | Annualized Rate | 90-Day Prorated |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client interactions | 648 (highest on team) | ~1,296 | ~324 |
| Total visits | 178 (highest on team) | ~356 | ~89 |
| Unique firms engaged | 177 (highest on team) | ~354 | ~88 |
| Unique firms via visit/demo | 81 (second highest) | ~162 | ~40 |
| Revenue (total) | $80,100 (70% of annual target) | ~$160,200 | ~$40,000 |
| Revenue (midyear only) | $26,300 (1 GDSF forecast) | ~$52,600 | ~$13,150 |
| RFQE onboards | 3 (PartnerRe, Mariner) | ~6 | ~1.5 |
| Strategic adoptions | 3 (none sustained) | ~6 | ~1.5 |
| CT C days | 11 | ~22 | ~5.5 |
| CT in-person meetings | 45 | ~90 | ~22.5 |
| CT accounts visited | 18 | ~36 | ~9 |

**Note on revenue complexity:** The employee's "total revenue" of $80,100 includes $53,800 that booked during leave from pre-leave pipeline. His in-period revenue at midyear was $26,300 from a single forecast. The annualized midyear revenue rate ($52,600) versus the annualized total rate ($160,200) represents the range. PIP revenue targets should be calibrated toward the higher end only if coverage is restored; toward the lower end if it is not.
