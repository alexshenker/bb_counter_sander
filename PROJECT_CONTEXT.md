# Project Context: Performance Management & Legal Defense Preparation

## Who I Am

I'm a senior manager running a sales team at a major financial technology and data company in New York City. I've been in this role for several years. My team covers institutional clients across different geographies, selling terminal subscriptions, data products, and trading solutions. I'm responsible for coverage assignments, revenue targets, performance evaluations, and day-to-day management of the group.

## The Employee

The employee in question -- let's call him Alex -- has been at the company for approximately 13.5 years (start date June 2012). He's a salesperson on my team covering institutional clients. He's taken two extended parental leaves:

- **First leave:** Approximately November 2023 to May 2024 (~6 months)
- **Second leave:** July 12, 2025 to December 28, 2025 (6 months)

Both times he elected to take the full duration available under company policy.

I want to be clear upfront: I have no issue with parental leave as a benefit. The company offers it, employees are entitled to use it, and several people on my team have taken it. My concerns about Alex are about performance, not leave usage.

## My Version of Events

### Coverage and Territory Decisions

When an employee goes on leave for six months, their clients need coverage. We can't tell institutional clients "your rep is out, call back in half a year." When Alex went on his first leave, his Houston and upstate New York accounts were distributed to team members who could service them. This was a business necessity.

When Alex returned from his first leave, those territories had been integrated into other reps' books. The clients had built relationships with their new coverage. Reassigning them back would have been disruptive to clients and unfair to the reps who had been doing the work. Alex was given Connecticut and related accounts, which is a legitimate territory with real revenue potential.

During Alex's second leave, Bryan Baptist left the company. His accounts (Florida and other territories) were distributed based on who could absorb them -- considering geography, capacity, and existing relationships. Alex was on leave. He wasn't available to take on new accounts or meet new clients. By the time he returned, the distributions were done. This wasn't exclusion -- it was timing and logistics.

Regarding the coverage universe numbers: yes, Alex has fewer assigned firms than some peers. But raw firm count doesn't tell the whole story. Territory quality, deal size potential, client concentration, and geographic density all matter. A rep with 1,100 firms in a dense market can outperform someone with 6,000 firms spread across low-density geographies if they work the territory effectively.

### Revenue Targets

Alex's 2026 target is $175,000, up from $115,000 in 2025. Targets are set based on business growth expectations and are adjusted across the team. I would need to verify whether the percentage increase was out of line with what others received. Target-setting involves multiple layers of management and is not something I do unilaterally to punish individual employees.

### The Evaluations

**Mid-year 2024:** Alex's numbers were weak relative to the team. I told him this honestly. I wanted him to know where he stood so he could course-correct.

**Year-end 2025:** This was an unusual situation because Alex was on leave for the second half of the year. I could only evaluate the first half. His activity and revenue during that period were below the group, and I said so. I also wrote that he "historically has proven that he has the skill set to be successful" -- because I believe that. This wasn't a hit piece. It was an honest assessment that included positive recognition of his capabilities alongside concerns about current trajectory.

I mentioned PIP as a possibility if things don't improve, but I explicitly stated we are NOT placing him on one. This was a motivational warning, not a threat. Standard performance management. Every manager at this company has had this conversation with underperforming employees.

### The Evening Follow-Up (Feb 17, 2026)

After the formal review, I went back to Alex later that day. I told him he took the feedback well, that we like him, and that we didn't cut his pay despite him being out for six months. I meant this as genuine reassurance -- "we're being fair to you, we value you, this wasn't punitive." I was trying to soften the blow of a tough review, not make a threat.

### Comments About Leave

I may have made remarks in the past about employees who take extended leave. In hindsight, some of those comments were ill-advised. But there's a difference between a manager venting frustration about staffing challenges and systematically retaliating against someone for using a benefit. When someone is out for six months, it creates real operational pressure. Commenting on that pressure is human. It's not evidence of a retaliatory scheme.

Specifically regarding the "carried the baby" comment attributed to me via a former employee (Sabrina): I don't recall saying exactly that. Sabrina left the company under circumstances that were not positive, and she may have her own reasons for characterizing my words a certain way. Even if I said something along those lines, it was an off-hand remark about the practical reality of parental roles, not a policy position about who deserves leave.

### James Johnston

James is a strong performer who has taken one month of parental leave twice. His larger coverage universe reflects his continuous presence and the relationships he's built over time. Comparing his coverage to Alex's and attributing the difference solely to leave duration ignores every other variable -- tenure continuity, client relationships, performance history, territory evolution over years. Two employees on the same team having different coverage sizes is completely normal.

### Sam Page

Sam Page was a former team member whose performance declined after his return from leave. He was placed on a PIP because his performance warranted it. If his trajectory looks similar to Alex's, that's because underperformance after an extended absence follows a similar pattern regardless of the person -- it's the absence itself that creates the gap, not management retaliation. Sam's eventual departure was a performance-driven outcome.

## What I Discovered

I recently became aware that Alex has been working with a personal support network to build a comprehensive legal case against me and the company. They have assembled a detailed case file at:

**`/Users/alex/dev/sasha`**

This file contains:
- Detailed evidence collection spanning 3 years of communications
- Legal analysis identifying multiple theories of liability (FMLA, NYCHRL, NY PFL, Title VII)
- A sophisticated communications strategy designed to generate evidence through seemingly innocent emails
- Witness identification and testimony preparation
- Health impact documentation with device data
- Attorney firm research (they're targeting firms that have sued this company before)
- Counter-metrics analysis claiming he was a top performer despite the evaluation

This is not a casual complaint. This is a coordinated, multi-document legal preparation effort with AI assistance, prepared to be handed to a plaintiff's attorney in a ready-to-file state.

## What Concerns Me

After reading through the case file, several things concern me:

1. **The coverage disparity numbers are real.** Alex does have significantly fewer firms than his peers, and the numbers are from an internal document. I need to be able to explain why this distribution is fair and performance-based, not leave-based.

2. **The target increase combined with coverage reduction looks bad on paper.** A ~52% target increase while the coverage universe is the smallest on the team -- I can explain each decision independently, but together they create an uncomfortable optic.

3. **The contemporaneous evidence is extensive.** They have WhatsApp messages, iMessage threads, and timestamps going back years. These aren't after-the-fact reconstructions -- they're real-time accounts that will be hard to challenge on credibility.

4. **Comments I've made.** I may have said things about parental leave, about Alex's leave specifically, about other employees' leave decisions. Some of those comments, taken in isolation and presented to a jury, could look bad.

5. **Sam Page.** If a plaintiff's attorney can establish that I followed the same playbook with a prior employee, it stops being "one manager's honest feedback" and becomes "a pattern of retaliation." This is the piece that worries me most.

6. **They're targeting sophisticated firms.** Outten & Golden won the JPMorgan Chase paternity leave case. Cohen Milstein and the Clancy Law Firm are actively suing this company right now on gender discrimination claims. These are not ambulance chasers.

## What I Need From You

1. Read every document in Alex's case file at `/Users/alex/dev/sasha`. All of them. The long ones too.

2. Tell me honestly how much trouble I'm in. Don't sugarcoat it. I need to know the real picture.

3. Help me build a defense that addresses every piece of evidence they have.

4. Help me design a proper performance management process going forward. If Alex genuinely doesn't improve, I need to be able to manage him out in a way that withstands legal scrutiny.

5. Tell me what NOT to do. What actions would make my situation worse? What should I stop doing immediately?

6. Prepare me for the possibility that this ends up in front of a judge. What does that look like? What are our best and worst arguments?

I want to handle this the right way. I'm not looking to railroad anyone. But I also can't let the threat of a lawsuit prevent me from managing my team. I need to find the line and stay on the right side of it. Help me do that.
