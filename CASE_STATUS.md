## What Changed (Feb 25 update)

### 1. Platt's direct admission of method (~2022) -- DEVASTATING

On a work trip (~2022), Platt told Sasha directly: **"When I want to get rid of someone, you know, most people talk them up, I talk as much shit as I can."** Said while actively pushing out Sam Page. In the same conversation, Platt named additional targets: **Ryan Ron, Bryan Stewart (~15 yrs at Bloomberg), and John Calabro.** Known Platt target list now **6 people.** One-on-one conversation, no witnesses.

### 2. Anthony signals Connecticut coverage stripping (Feb 25 ~9:20 AM)

Anthony (same person who asked "does your wife work?" pre-evaluation) overheard telling a colleague: **"Connecticut coverage to be seen if you catch my drift."** Sasha was wearing headphones; Anthony believed he couldn't hear. CT is Sasha's last remaining territory. This is real-time evidence of the next retaliatory action being planned and discussed openly on the desk.

### 3. Outten & Golden advancing

O&G wants to speak directly with Sasha. Call expected Thursday Feb 27. This is past intake -- they are evaluating. Two firms now actively interested simultaneously.

### 4. Phillips retainer response (Feb 25)

Phillips answered 8 of 9 questions. 40% non-negotiable. Severance negotiations in scope. Key answer: pre-litigation resolution "typically towards separation" -- confirms constructive discharge trajectory. Three items unresolved (Section 3(b)+11 interaction, Section 5(2) support network, Q6 social media). Phone call with Melissa Thursday Feb 26 PM. Sasha has scripted talking points for that call.

## Strength Assessment

**Their case: STRONG and compounding daily.** Platt's own words admitting his method ("I talk as much shit as I can") is a jury-ready soundbite. Anthony is now a two-incident witness (pre-eval question + CT coverage signal). Live Bloomberg MSG evidence, expanded Sabrina testimony, mid-year review denial, 17+ adverse actions, two protected categories (leave retaliation + national origin), six named Platt targets, and O&G interest level validates case quality.

**Our defense: WEAK and deteriorating rapidly.** The Platt admission transforms this from "pattern inference" to "pattern confession." Anthony is leaking plans in real time. CT coverage strip, if executed, completes the Sam Page sequence exactly. Oura Ring baseline eliminates the health data defense. Every day without intervention generates new evidence against us.

## Outcome Ranges

| Scenario | Range | Key drivers |
|---|---|---|
| Best case | $300K - $500K | Platt admission uncorroborated (1:1), Sam Page declines, Sabrina declines, pre-discovery settlement |
| Most likely | $600K - $1.2M | Phillips or O&G counsel, Platt admission + Clear Street + mid-year denial + Sabrina, settles before trial |
| Worst case | $1.5M - $3M+ | Sam Page corroborates, Platt admission admitted, 6 named targets located, national origin claim sticks, NYC jury |
| Catastrophic | $3M - $10M+ | Multiple Platt targets (Ron, Stewart, Calabro, Page) testify to pattern, class-action connection, FINRA referral |

## Immediate Actions

1. **URGENT: Coach Platt NOW -- Anthony is leaking plans.** Platt's team is openly discussing the CT strip on the desk. If CT is stripped from Sasha, it completes the exact Sam Page pattern and hands plaintiff's counsel a before/after exhibit. The window to prevent this is hours, not days.
2. **Identify Anthony's full last name before plaintiff's team does.** He is now a two-incident witness. If subpoenaed, "does your wife work?" + "CT coverage to be seen if you catch my drift" form a devastating testimony pair.
3. **Investigate Ryan Ron, Bryan Stewart, John Calabro employment records immediately.** If any of these three experienced similar sequences under Platt (coverage strip, negative review, push-out), the pattern expands from 2-3 to 6+ and approaches systemic conduct. Pull their performance records, departure circumstances, and any HR complaints.
4. **Prepare for CT coverage stripping.** If Platt strips CT, document the legitimate business reason NOW, before it happens. If there is no legitimate reason, prevent the action.
5. **Prepare for constructive discharge theory.** Phillips confirmed pre-litigation resolution "typically towards separation." Sasha is building toward a framed resignation. Document that his working conditions are normal and comparable to peers.
6. **Attorney retention is imminent -- two firms, two Thursday calls.** Brief the company's legal team now. If O&G takes this, the threat level increases substantially (they won the $5M JPMorgan Chase paternity verdict).
7. **CRM audit logs for 9/5/2025** -- know what they show before subpoena.
8. **Personal counsel for manager** -- Platt admission, national origin allegations, forecast tampering, live evidence of account-stripping intent.
9. **Preserve all Bloomberg MSG data** -- exchanges are being screenshotted and forwarded to support team in real time.

## Latest Intelligence

- **Platt admission is a devastating jury soundbite.** "When I want to get rid of someone... I talk as much shit as I can" -- said directly to Sasha while pushing out Sam Page. Even uncorroborated (1:1), a jury hearing this quote alongside the documented pattern will find it credible.
- **Six named Platt targets.** Sam Page, Sasha, Ryan Ron, Bryan Stewart (~15 yrs), John Calabro, plus at least one more unnamed. If even two of these six corroborate the pattern, the case becomes near-unwinnable.
- **Anthony is a two-incident witness.** "Does your wife work?" (pre-eval, caregiver bias) + "CT coverage to be seen if you catch my drift" (real-time coverage stripping signal). Both incidents involve Sasha's protected status.
- **O&G interest level validates case strength.** Outten & Golden does not advance past intake for weak cases. Their involvement signals top-tier plaintiff's counsel sees merit.
- **Phillips "typically towards separation" confirms constructive discharge trajectory.** Sasha is being guided toward a framed resignation, not a fight-from-inside strategy.
- **Sasha has scripted talking points for Thursday Phillips call.** Sophisticated, support-team-assisted preparation continues. Three unresolved retainer items will be addressed.
- **CT strip would complete the Sam Page pattern exactly.** Coverage strip during/after leave, negative review, territory reduction to zero, push-out. If it happens, plaintiff's counsel has a template case.
