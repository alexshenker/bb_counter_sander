## What Changed Today (Feb 24)

1. **EVENT 014 -- Clear Street account stripping caught live.** Bloomberg MSG, 7:47 AM: Platt questioned whether Sasha self-assigned Clear Street -- an account Platt himself assigned during a 1:1 the prior week. Platt: "I just dont remember assigning it" and "I thought I had reassigned to Tommy." Same day, Clear Street generated 403mm notional / ~$1,950 base fees. Platt still framed it as Sasha's gap ("prob doesnt know about switch"). This is timestamped, contemporaneous evidence in Bloomberg's own systems showing account-stripping intent mid-act.

2. **EVENT 015 -- Mid-year review denial confirmed.** During second leave, Platt scheduled Sasha's mid-year review, required in-person attendance, said he'd "check with HR," then posted it unilaterally without Sasha's input. Sabrina confirmed: "Smh we never had one he posted the review." Closed-loop trap: blocked feedback, then penalized for not improving. Now Adverse Action A.7.

3. **Sabrina evidence expanded.** Full iMessage thread transcribed (standalone file). Key: "he retaliates against people who go on leave especially men" dated ~September 9, 2025 -- five months before Feb 2026 eval. Also confirmed: Platt called Sasha's accounts "shitty," territory inequity, Santore approves reviews, HR exit interview was "veeeerrrry honest."

4. **Phillips retainer: PRE-LITIGATION ONLY.** 40% on gross. Section 11: P&A drops at Right to Sue letter. Section 5(2): confidentiality clause restricts Sasha from discussing case without attorney consent (threatens support team). Section 3(b): may let P&A claim recovery share after they stop representing. Sasha sent structured clarifying questions Feb 24. Still comparing firms (Outten & Golden awaiting callback; Cohen Milstein/Wigdor/Derek Smith not yet called).

5. **Platt behavioral shift.** Uncharacteristically formal WFH email (Feb 23). Clear Street exchange uses performatively supportive tone. May indicate HR/legal coaching or heightened self-awareness.

6. **Adverse actions count: 17** (was 14). Added: mid-year review denial, paper trail creation, same-day performance framing.

## Strength Assessment

**Their case: STRONG and compounding daily.** Live Bloomberg MSG evidence, expanded Sabrina testimony, mid-year review denial, 17 adverse actions, two protected categories (leave retaliation + national origin).

**Our defense: WEAK and deteriorating.** Clear Street exchanges are devastating -- live, timestamped, in company systems, showing the catch-22 in real time. Mid-year review denial closes the "he should have improved" argument. Every day Platt interacts with Sasha, new evidence is generated.

## Outcome Ranges

| Scenario | Range | Key drivers |
|---|---|---|
| Best case | $300K - $500K | Forecast tampering disproven, Sam Page declines, Sabrina declines formal cooperation, pre-discovery settlement |
| Most likely | $600K - $1.2M | Phillips or better counsel, Clear Street + mid-year denial + expanded Sabrina, settles before trial |
| Worst case | $1.5M - $3M+ | Sam Page corroborates, full pattern finding, national origin claim sticks, NYC jury |
| Catastrophic | $3M - $10M+ | Cohen Milstein / class-action connection, FINRA referral, multiple employees |

## Immediate Actions

1. **Coach Platt NOW.** He is generating live evidence in Bloomberg systems daily. The Clear Street exchange alone could anchor a trial exhibit.
2. **CRM audit logs for 9/5/2025** -- most time-sensitive item, unchanged. Know what they show before subpoena.
3. **Identify Tommy** from Clear Street exchange -- is this the same person who received the CT lead?
4. **Prepare mid-year review defense** -- was there a policy requiring in-person reviews during leave?
5. **Monitor retainer status** -- Sasha may sign Phillips or choose another firm within days.
6. **Personal counsel for manager** -- national origin + forecast tampering + live evidence of account-stripping intent.

- Support team did section-by-section legal analysis of Phillips retainer -- sophisticated preparation
- Evidence strategy: build on iMessage + Bloomberg docs + testimony; keep WhatsApp out unless demanded in discovery
- Sabrina's HR exit interview was "veeeerrrry honest" -- pull those notes immediately
