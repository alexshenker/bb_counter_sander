# Case Status Brief

**Last updated:** February 21, 2026 (evening)

## Current Posture

**Phase:** Pre-litigation. No attorney retained yet.
**Next critical date:** Monday Feb 23 -- employee calls 5 plaintiff's firms (Cohen Milstein first, already suing Bloomberg). Attorney retention expected within days.
**Follow-up meeting with manager:** ~March 5-10.

## His Case: STRONG

The evaluation says he "can't improve" because of leave, then penalizes him for not improving. Coverage is 5.4x lower than the comparator who took short leave. He led the team in activity but was rated worst. Manager's statements tying decisions to leave are corroborated by multiple timestamped sources. Two consecutive leave-then-punishment cycles. All under NYCHRL's "motivating factor" standard with uncapped damages.

**New developments (Feb 21 afternoon):** Four things changed since this morning, all of which strengthen the employee's position if they hold up:

1. **Sabrina Sparapani iMessage evidence captured.** New transcripts show she wrote "he retaliates against people who go on leave especially men" in July 2025, claims she experienced the same playbook herself, and says she complained about Platt in her HR exit interview. She is at BlackRock. **Caveat:** Her formal willingness to cooperate with an attorney (as opposed to chatting with a friend) is unconfirmed. Some of her statements are still her characterizations of events -- not independently verified.

2. **Sabrina claims Bloomberg HR was informed.** She says she was "veeeerrrry honest" in her exit interview and that HR "was taking notes." If true, this could establish institutional knowledge. **Caveat:** We do not know what she actually said, what HR recorded, or whether the notes mention leave retaliation specifically. HR exit interviews often capture general complaints. The actual content of those notes is unknown until they surface in discovery.

3. **Chain of command is mapped.** Rich Santore (Platt's boss) was present at the evaluation, and per Sabrina approves Platt's reviews. Hal (Santore's boss) is reportedly Platt's personal friend. This makes internal escalation look impractical -- but it does not establish that Santore or Hal participated in retaliation.

4. **Forecast tampering allegation now has specific mechanics.** Sasha claims Platt closed his ~$58K forecast as "dupe" on 9/5/2025, stripped notes, reopened under his own name. **Caveat:** This is entirely Sasha's account. No photos have been provided or reviewed. Dollar amount doesn't match the evaluation ($58K vs $53,800). The opponent's own team labels it "partially confirmed" and "details pending." It becomes strong evidence only if the CRM audit trail confirms it.

## Our Defense: MODERATE -- but under new pressure

**What works:** Qualitative deficiencies in the eval (adoptions, visit breadth, day structure). Employee's own "pulling back on effort" WhatsApp messages. Mass layoffs provide partial comp cover. Sabrina's credibility can be challenged (her own grievances, potential bias). Forecast tampering is unverified. Their own gaps (pre-leave coverage baseline, target methodology, Sam Page details) remain unfilled.

**What's weaker than before (updated evening):**
- Feb 17 email is NOT the defensive asset we thought. ~~His "concession email"~~ is actually generic boilerplate ("I appreciate the time yesterday"). No acceptance of the evaluation, no "I'm aligned," no gratitude for guidance. Negligible defensive value.
- GDSF forecast count: eval says "only 1 GDSF forecast ($26,300)" but employee has identified 4 forecasts totaling $50,300 with specific CRM IDs. If confirmed, this is a provably false statement in the evaluation.
- Client visit count: eval cited ~11 CT visits, employee claims 19 total C-days. Two instances of understated metrics form a selective data presentation pattern.
- Their "Retaliation Cascade" theory directly neutralizes the WhatsApp "doing it on purpose" messages -- our strongest defense weapon -- by reframing disengagement as a consequence of the first-cycle retaliation.
- If Sabrina formally cooperates, the "single disgruntled employee" defense erodes. If the HR exit interview notes contain specific complaints, the "company didn't know" defense is harder. The chain of command mapping makes "you should have complained internally" look hollow.

## Likely Outcomes

| Scenario | Range | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Best case | $200K - $400K | Forecast tampering disproven, Sam Page clean, Sabrina declines formal cooperation, strong documentation, weaker counsel, pre-discovery settlement |
| Most likely | $500K - $1.5M | Competent counsel, survives summary judgment, Sabrina cooperates to some degree, settles before/during trial |
| Worst case | $1.5M - $3M+ | Sam Page corroborates, Sabrina testifies fully, forecast tampering confirmed, NYC jury verdict with punitive damages |
| Catastrophic | $3M - $10M+ | Cohen Milstein connects to Ndugga class action, pattern finding, FINRA referral adds regulatory pressure |

These ranges are largely unchanged from prior version. Sabrina's evidence is significant but her formal cooperation is uncertain. If she cooperates AND the HR exit interview notes are damaging AND the forecast tampering is confirmed, the most likely range shifts upward. Those are three separate ifs.

## Personal Risk to You (the Manager)

**Individual liability:** Under NYCHRL, individual supervisors can be held personally liable as "aiders and abettors" of discriminatory conduct. You are not just a company witness -- you are a potential individual defendant.

**Deposition exposure:** You are the primary deposition target. Every attributed statement, every coverage decision, and every line of the evaluation flows through you. See LITIGATION_PREP.md Section 5 for the 32 questions you will face.

**Career risk:** If Bloomberg's internal investigation confirms the alleged pattern, your position becomes untenable. Companies settle these cases and then deal with the manager separately.

**Sabrina's testimony (if she cooperates):** Her iMessage statements identify you by name and describe specific conduct. If she sits for a deposition, she would describe what she experienced under your management. However, whether she will formally cooperate with a plaintiff's attorney is unknown. Chatting with a former colleague over iMessage is not the same as agreeing to testify.

**Santore exposure:** The employee's team has identified that Santore approves your reviews and was present at the evaluation. If Santore's communications are subpoenaed, anything showing he knew about or condoned the alleged treatment is problematic -- and creates a situation where Bloomberg may seek to distance itself from you.

**Forecast tampering allegation -- STILL THE MOST URGENT ITEM:** This is the only allegation that, if substantiated, constitutes potential fraud rather than management judgment. Their team has specific mechanics now (9/5/2025, "dupe" closure, same-day reopen) but no independent verification. They are holding it for the attorney and have explicitly told Sasha not to report to FINRA yet. **You need to determine what the audit logs show before anyone else pulls them.** If the logs show a routine business action, this dies. If they confirm what Sasha describes, this becomes the most dangerous element of the case -- it provides a motive narrative (suppressed his numbers, then rated him as underperforming) and creates regulatory exposure that is personal to you.

**What to do:** Retain your own employment attorney (separate from Bloomberg's counsel) for personal advice. Bloomberg's defense team represents Bloomberg, not you. If the forecast allegation creates a conflict between your interests and Bloomberg's, you need independent counsel.

## What to Do Now

1. **Litigation hold** -- preserve all records (Sasha, Sam Page, Sabrina Sparapani, Johnston, full team, Santore, stack ranking docs) back to Jan 2018. Include Sabrina's HR exit interview notes and CRM forecast audit trails.
2. **Retain defense counsel** -- before Monday if possible; employee is targeting 5 top-tier firms
3. **Retain personal counsel for the manager** -- given forecast tampering allegation and potential interest divergence with Bloomberg
4. **Determine forecast audit logs** -- what do they show for 9/5/2025? Legitimate business action or what Sasha describes? This is the single most time-sensitive item.
5. **Pull Sabrina's HR exit interview notes** -- determine what she actually told HR and what was documented
6. **Pull GDSF forecast records for ALL team members** -- the eval says "only 1 GDSF forecast ($26,300)" but the employee claims 4 totaling $50,300 with specific CRM IDs. Verify what the CRM shows and understand the counting methodology used. If the eval is provably wrong, prepare an explanation.
7. **Investigate Sam Page** -- his file remains a major variable
8. **Pull comparative data** -- team-wide targets, coverage history, evaluations, comp outcomes, visit counts (CT-only vs all-territory for all team members)
9. **Implement remedial coverage/target actions BEFORE Monday Feb 23** -- every remedial action has been pre-framed as "consciousness of guilt" by their team. Act now with documented business rationale (territory optimization, Q1 planning) before attorney outreach begins. After a demand letter, it's a concession.
10. **Identify Anthony (last name unknown)** -- manager on separate team who asked Sasha "does your wife work?" If he's a friendly witness, good. If he asked because he knew about the stack ranking, bad. Find him before they do.
11. **Prepare for March meeting** -- script responses to coverage/target questions; assume Sasha may have attorney guidance by then
12. **Defer PIP** -- at least until Q3 2026
13. **Do not contact Sabrina, Sam Page, or any former employee.** Any outreach will be characterized as witness tampering.

## Latest Intelligence (Feb 21, evening)

**Seven items identified from opponent's files not previously captured in defense documents (now integrated):**

1. **GDSF forecast omission (CRITICAL).** Evaluation says "only 1 GDSF forecast booked ($26,300)" but employee has 4 forecasts totaling $50,300 with CRM IDs #1398757, #1409461, #1393077 plus one more. If CRM confirms 4, the evaluation contains a provably false factual claim.

2. **Retaliation Cascade legal theory.** Employee's team (Section F) argues first-cycle retaliation caused the disengagement that caused the underperformance that caused the second-cycle evaluation. This directly neutralizes the WhatsApp defense by reframing it as a consequence chain. Must break at the first link (proving the 0% raise was legitimate).

3. **Visit cherry-picking specifics.** 19 total C-days vs 11 CT-only cited in eval. Allegation: manager counted narrower methodology for Sasha while counting all-territory visits for peers. Combined with GDSF omission, forms a "selective data presentation" pattern.

4. **Anthony witness + stack ranking.** Manager on separate team asked Sasha "does your wife work?" unprompted. Employee's theory: Anthony saw low stack ranking. Stack ranking sessions are documented Bloomberg processes where all managers see all rankings. Those session records are discoverable.

5. **Mariner Pod work-during-leave.** Sasha logged in during leave to demo product to client. Manager declined his offer to help, then criticized his results. "He wanted to work, you said no, then you blamed him for not working."

6. **Opponent's pre-framed counter-moves (Section G).** Every remedial action (coverage restoration, target adjustment, coaching plan, behavioral changes, delayed PIP) has been pre-characterized as "consciousness of guilt." Does not mean we shouldn't act -- just means everything needs contemporaneous business documentation.

7. **Intelligence from their gaps (FACTS.md, Questions_for_Sasha.md).** They have 267 unconfirmed facts and 77 unanswered questions. Key gaps: pre-leave coverage baseline, Sam Page details, target-setting methodology, Johnston's leave decisions, GDSF counting methodology, Anthony's identity, Sabrina's formal cooperation, exact timeline of coverage changes.

**Previously reported (still current):** Sabrina iMessage evidence, forecast tampering mechanics (9/5/2025), chain of command mapping, Monday Playbook targeting 5 firms starting Monday Feb 23.
