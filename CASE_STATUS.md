# Case Status Brief

**Last updated:** February 23, 2026 (evening)

---

## Current Posture

**Phase:** ESCALATED. Attorney contact initiated. One firm interested in representing, retainer expected imminently.
**Next critical date:** Retainer signing (days away). Then March 5-10 follow-up meeting -- employee will have attorney guidance.
**Follow-up meeting with manager:** ~March 5-10.

---

## CRITICAL CHANGE: ATTORNEY ENGAGED

As of today (Feb 23), the employee has made contact with two firms and one wants to represent him:

1. **Outten & Golden LLP** -- 11-minute intake call at 11:30 AM. Awaiting callback. This firm won the $5M Rotondo v. JPMorgan Chase paternity leave class action.

2. **Phillips & Associates** -- 50-minute substantive consultation at 1:37 PM. **The attorney said this "definitely seems like a retaliation case" and is interested in representing Sasha.** Retainer at 40% contingency forthcoming. The attorney confirmed that at Bloomberg, getting 0% bonus is "essentially unheard of" unless being positioned for a PIP.

Sasha told the attorney he does **not want to keep working at Bloomberg**. His goal is a negotiated exit with compensation, not reinstatement. This shapes their entire strategy -- they are building toward a settlement demand, not a return-to-status-quo.

Sasha is comparing firms before signing. He still plans to contact Cohen Milstein/Clancy, Wigdor, and Derek Smith. But the Phillips attorney already has the case overview and wants in.

**What this means for us:** The window for proactive defensive measures is closing. Once a retainer is signed, all of Sasha's communications with Bloomberg will be attorney-guided. The March meeting becomes a coached event. Any demand letter could arrive within weeks. Bloomberg counsel needs to be retained and briefed NOW if not already done.

## NEW DIMENSION: National Origin Discrimination (Feb 23)

A new claim emerged during today's attorney contacts that was previously unknown:

- **"Comrade"**: Platt regularly called Sasha "Comrade" as a greeting ("Good morning, Comrade") in front of the entire team (Emily, JJ, Sabrina). Sasha is Russian. This was **recurring over at least the last year**, used **more often than Sasha's actual name**. Platt has since STOPPED -- Sasha says "he knows I'll use it against him." That self-correction is itself evidence of consciousness of wrongdoing.

- **"Rahul"**: Platt repeatedly called Indian team member Bryan Baptist by the stereotypical Indian name "Rahul." Bryan was visibly annoyed but didn't formally object. Recurring, not a one-time incident.

**Impact on defense:** This opens a NYCHRL national origin discrimination / hostile work environment claim in addition to the leave retaliation claims. It broadens the pattern from "Platt retaliates against leave-takers" to "Platt has a general discriminatory animus across multiple protected categories." Under NYCHRL, a single severe incident can suffice; recurring epithets over a year easily clear the bar.

**Honest assessment:** The "Comrade" allegation is hard to defend. If team members confirm it (Emily, JJ, and Sabrina were all present), there is no plausible innocent explanation for calling your Russian employee "Comrade" more often than his actual name, especially when the same manager called his Indian employee by a random Indian name. The fact that Platt stopped is particularly damaging -- it shows he knew it was wrong.

**Mitigation options are limited.** Bloomberg could argue it was an informal term of endearment, but the recurring nature, team-wide visibility, and the parallel "Rahul" misnaming of a different ethnic minority employee undercut that argument. Bryan Baptist, who has left Bloomberg, is now a potential witness on the national origin dimension.

## His Case: STRONG and Strengthening

Everything from the Feb 21 assessment remains accurate. The following has changed:

**Upgraded factors:**
- He now has an attorney who wants to represent him (Phillips & Associates, $1.8M Pardovani verdict firm)
- National origin claim adds a second protected category
- Compensation data is confirmed ($198K base + $42K bonus = $240K/yr), anchoring settlement calculations
- Phillips attorney independently confirmed 0% Bloomberg bonus is abnormal
- Their support team has built a comprehensive 293-fact master verification list and 77 open questions for Sasha to validate -- this is meticulous preparation
- They have prepared a strategic pre-March-meeting email (attorney review required before sending) designed to put coverage expansion and written targets on the record

**Still unresolved (their gaps remain our opportunities):**
- Sam Page: uncontacted, cooperation unknown
- Sabrina: communicating informally but formal cooperation with an attorney unconfirmed
- Forecast tampering: photos still not provided, $58K/$53.8K discrepancy unresolved
- Pre-leave coverage baseline: still no data showing what Sasha's coverage was before first leave
- WhatsApp disengagement messages: still their biggest vulnerability, still undisclosed to attorney (they plan to disclose at first full consultation)

---

## Our Defense: MODERATE -- sliding toward WEAK unless action is taken

**What still works:**
- Qualitative deficiencies in the eval (adoptions that didn't stick, shortened days) remain legitimate performance concerns
- Mass layoffs (Feb 11) provide partial cover for zero comp
- The WhatsApp "doing it on purpose" messages remain devastating IF they surface -- but their team is actively strategizing how to build the case without introducing WhatsApp, relying instead on iMessage evidence
- Forecast tampering remains unverified -- photos pending, dollar amounts don't match
- Sam Page is uncontacted -- if he declines to cooperate or contradicts the pattern, that's a major blow to their case

**What's gotten worse since Feb 21:**
- An attorney is now substantively involved and has already validated the case ("definitely retaliation")
- The national origin dimension ("Comrade" / "Rahul") is new, credible, and hard to defend
- Their settlement framework is sophisticated -- three components (damages + severance + career damage), with a "most likely" range of $550K-$750K
- They have scripted intake answers, consultation talking points, and firm-specific questions -- this is an organized, supported litigant, not a confused employee fumbling through intake calls
- Their pre-March-meeting email is designed as a strategic trap: it asks for coverage expansion and written targets, creating a three-way fork where every possible response (agree, stall, or refuse) helps their case
- Phillips attorney confirmed the 0% bonus is outside Bloomberg norms -- this undercuts the "it was a company-wide austerity" defense

## Likely Outcomes (Updated)

| Scenario | Range | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Best case | $250K - $450K | Forecast tampering disproven, Sam Page declines, Sabrina declines formal cooperation, weaker counsel, WhatsApp surfaces in discovery and damages case, pre-discovery settlement |
| Most likely | $550K - $1M | Phillips-caliber counsel, survives summary judgment, Sabrina cooperates to some degree, settles before trial. National origin claim adds leverage. |
| Worst case | $1.5M - $3M+ | Sam Page corroborates, Sabrina testifies fully, forecast tampering confirmed, national origin claim sticks, NYC jury verdict with punitive damages |
| Catastrophic | $3M - $10M+ | Cohen Milstein connection to Ndugga class action, pattern finding across multiple employees, FINRA referral adds regulatory pressure |

**What moved:** Best case is slightly higher (national origin claim adds baseline settlement value). Most likely range has narrowed upward because an attorney is now involved and the compensation data ($240K/yr) sets a high floor for severance calculations.

## Personal Risk to You (the Manager) -- ELEVATED

Everything from Feb 21 remains applicable, plus:

**National origin exposure is personal.** "Comrade" and "Rahul" are attributed directly to you. If the team confirms these -- and Emily, JJ, and Sabrina were all allegedly present -- this is personal conduct, not a management decision that Bloomberg policy can explain away. Bloomberg may distance itself from this behavior specifically.

**Attorney is now coaching Sasha.** The March meeting is no longer a manager-employee check-in. It is likely an attorney-directed evidence-gathering exercise. Sasha's team has already drafted a pre-meeting email designed to force you into a documented coverage/targets response. Expect every word you say at that meeting to be documented and sent to the attorney within 24 hours.

**The "thought he was quitting" admission.** The Phillips attorney now has this. Expect it in any demand letter or complaint as evidence that you rated Sasha low for non-performance reasons (assumption he was leaving, not actual work quality).

**Forecast tampering remains the most personal risk.** Still unverified but the attorney now knows about it. If CRM audit logs confirm Sasha's account, this creates potential FINRA exposure that is yours individually, not Bloomberg's. Their team has explicitly told Sasha to hold the FINRA angle for the attorney to deploy strategically.

## What to Do Now (UPDATED -- several items now time-critical)

### IMMEDIATE (today/tomorrow)

1. **Retain Bloomberg defense counsel** if not already done. The employee has an interested attorney and retainer is imminent. Bloomberg needs counsel ready.
2. **Retain personal counsel for the manager** -- separate from Bloomberg. The national origin allegations and forecast tampering allegation create potential interest divergence.
3. **Check the CRM audit logs for 9/5/2025.** What do they show? This is still the single most time-sensitive item. The attorney will likely subpoena these. Know what they say before the other side does.
4. **Pull Sabrina's HR exit interview notes** -- the attorney will want to know what Bloomberg has on record.

### THIS WEEK

5. **Investigate Sam Page's file** -- when was he terminated? What was documented? What would his file look like in discovery?
6. **Pull GDSF forecast records** -- verify the eval's "only 1 forecast" claim against CRM data. If there were 4 forecasts, prepare an explanation for why 3 were omitted.
7. **Pull comparative data** for all team members: targets (2025 and 2026), coverage universe assignments over time, evaluation ratings, comp outcomes.
8. **Identify Anthony** (last name) -- the manager who asked Sasha "does your wife work?" Determine what he knows and what he saw in stack ranking sessions.
9. **Prepare for the March meeting** -- assume Sasha will arrive with attorney guidance, a pre-scripted agenda email, and a plan to document everything. Script responses to: "Can we expand my coverage?" and "What are my specific 2026 targets?" Every answer must be defensible as reasonable, non-retaliatory management.

### STRATEGIC

10. **Do NOT contact Sabrina, Sam Page, Bryan Baptist, or any former employee.** Witness contact will be characterized as tampering.
11. **Do NOT implement coverage changes, target adjustments, or behavioral shifts before the March meeting without contemporaneous business documentation.** Their team has pre-framed every remedial action as consciousness of guilt. If you restore coverage now, it looks like you know the current allocation is indefensible. If you don't, the disparity persists as evidence. The solution: any changes must have documented business rationale that predates the legal threat (territory optimization, Q1 planning, team restructuring).
12. **Defer PIP** -- at least until Q3 2026, and only with bulletproof documentation.
13. **Do NOT mention "Comrade," leave, pregnancy, or family status in any context.** The national origin dimension means every ethnic reference, however casual, is now potential evidence.
14. **Prepare a "Comrade" defense.** If confronted (in deposition or demand letter), what is the explanation? "Term of endearment," "office banter," "he never objected"? None of these are strong, but they need to be consistent and prepared in advance.
15. **Consider whether Bryan Baptist is a risk.** He left Bloomberg, was reportedly annoyed by the "Rahul" misnaming, and his coverage was redistributed to everyone except Sasha. If the plaintiff's attorney finds him, he could corroborate both the national origin pattern and the selective coverage distribution.

## Latest Intelligence (Feb 23)

### New items since Feb 21

1. **Phillips & Associates wants to represent Sasha.** 50-minute consultation, attorney validated the case, 40% contingency retainer forthcoming. Sasha comparing firms before signing.

2. **National origin discrimination evidence.** "Comrade" (recurring, more frequent than his actual name, team witnessed, Platt stopped using it) and "Rahul" (recurring misnaming of Indian colleague). Opens NYCHRL hostile work environment claim.

3. **Compensation confirmed.** $198K base + $42K bonus = $240K/yr. Two zeroed bonus cycles = $84K concrete losses. Attorney confirmed 0% bonus is abnormal at Bloomberg.

4. **Their settlement framework.** Three components: damages ($350K-$450K), severance ($198K-$297K), career damage premium (variable). Most likely total: $550K-$750K. They're coaching Sasha on fee negotiation to save $45K+ on the contingency rate.

5. **Pre-March-meeting email drafted.** Strategic email asking for coverage expansion and written 2026 targets. Designed to create documented evidence regardless of response. Will be attorney-reviewed before sending.

6. **293 facts catalogued.** They have built a comprehensive FACTS.md for Sasha to verify. This is a well-organized plaintiff with meticulous preparation.

7. **Blizzard cover.** NYC travel ban on Feb 23 gave Sasha WFH cover to make attorney calls without using a sick day. Sick day preserved for future consultation. Routine WFH email sent to Platt.

8. **Their evidence strategy on WhatsApp.** They are actively planning to build the case WITHOUT introducing the WhatsApp group chat, relying instead on iMessage threads (Erb, Sabrina) and direct testimony. The disengagement messages ("I'm doing it on purpose") exist only in WhatsApp. If they succeed in keeping WhatsApp out, our strongest defense evidence never enters the record. The attorney will decide this.

### Previously reported (unchanged)

- Sabrina iMessage evidence and HR exit interview claim
- Forecast tampering mechanics (9/5/2025) -- photos still pending
- GDSF forecast omission (4 vs 1)
- Visit cherry-picking (19 vs 11)
- Retaliation Cascade theory
- Chain of command mapping (Platt -> Santore -> Anderson)
- Anthony witness + stack ranking
- Sam Page: uncontacted, cooperation unknown
- Their gaps remain: pre-leave baseline, target methodology, Sam Page details, Sabrina's formal cooperation status
