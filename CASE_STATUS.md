# Case Status Brief

**Last updated:** February 27, 2026
**Phase:** CRITICAL -- ATTORNEY SELECTION IMMINENT. Outten & Golden spoke with Sasha Feb 26: "very strong case," 35% contingency, follow-up Monday March 2. Phillips at 40%, pre-litigation only. O&G told Sasha he can stay at Bloomberg -- "stay and fight" option is now live. Sabrina thriving at BlackRock with client praise, further destroying "poor performer" defense against her credibility.
**Next critical dates:** Monday March 2 (Nina/O&G follow-up -- likely decisive call for firm selection). March 5-10 (follow-up meeting with manager). CT coverage strip may be imminent.

## What Changed (Feb 27 update)

### 1. Outten & Golden call happened (Feb 26) -- O&G is now the frontrunner

Nina (O&G attorney) spoke directly with Sasha on Feb 26. Key outcomes: **"very strong case"** assessment, **35% contingency** (vs Phillips' 40%), **$1,500 consultation fee waived**, and critical strategic framing -- told Sasha he **can stay at Bloomberg** and that Bloomberg "might offer him more to leave" once the case is in motion. This is a fundamentally different posture from Phillips' separation-oriented approach. Follow-up call **Monday March 2** to formally consult. Critical gaps remain: litigation scope (does O&G handle through trial or just pre-litigation?), severance treatment, retainer terms. If O&G handles full litigation at 35%, it is the clearly superior option.

### 2. Sabrina thriving at BlackRock -- "poor performer" defense collapsing (Feb 26)

Sabrina texted Sasha screenshots of two internal BlackRock emails: **NYSTRS** praised her engagement ("fantastic addition"), **GMO's CTO and COO** praised her support ("very appreciative," "very thankful"). These are third-party client emails relayed to directors and MDs. Then Sabrina wrote: **"So yeah Teddy can shove everything he was trying to do to me last year up his ass."** She left Platt's team ~July 2025, joined BlackRock ~September 2025. Within 5 months, she is getting director/MD-level client praise at a major competitor. The "Sabrina was a poor performer" defense is now substantially weaker. The "everything he was trying to do to me" language is another unprompted, contemporaneous statement attributing her treatment to Platt's deliberate actions.

### 3. "Stay and fight" option is now live

O&G's framing that Sasha can remain employed while the case proceeds changes the operational dynamic. Previously, Phillips' separation-oriented approach suggested Sasha would exit. Now Sasha may stay, continue documenting, and force Bloomberg to either tolerate him (during which every interaction is monitored) or make a move that becomes additional evidence. Any PIP, coverage change, or management action becomes a real-time litigation exhibit reviewed by O&G counsel.

### 4. Two firms competing -- decision by early March

Phillips: 40% non-negotiable, pre-litigation only, three items still unresolved. O&G: 35%, firm reputation substantially stronger, full litigation scope unknown but possible. The fee comparison on a $650K recovery: Sasha nets $390K with Phillips vs $422.5K with O&G. Do not sign either firm until after the Monday March 2 O&G call.

## Strength Assessment

**Their case: STRONG and compounding daily.** Platt admission ("I talk as much shit as I can") is a jury-ready soundbite. Anthony is a two-incident witness. Sabrina now thriving at BlackRock with third-party client praise -- destroys "poor performer" credibility attack. Live Bloomberg MSG evidence, mid-year review denial, 17+ adverse actions, two protected categories, six named Platt targets, and O&G "very strong case" assessment validates case quality. O&G at 35% with possible full litigation scope is the worst-case opposing counsel scenario.

**Our defense: WEAK and deteriorating rapidly.** The Platt admission transforms pattern from inference to confession. Sabrina's BlackRock success destroys the primary credibility attack against our strongest corroborating witness. O&G's "stay and fight" advice means Sasha may not exit quietly -- every future management action becomes a real-time exhibit. CT coverage strip, if executed, completes the Sam Page sequence exactly. Every day without intervention generates new evidence against us.

## Outcome Ranges

| Scenario | Range | Key drivers |
|---|---|---|
| Best case | $350K - $550K | Platt admission uncorroborated (1:1), Sam Page declines, Sabrina declines formal cooperation, pre-discovery settlement. Floor raised by Sabrina BlackRock evidence existing regardless of her cooperation. |
| Most likely | $700K - $1.5M | O&G counsel at 35% (aggressive, full-litigation firm), Platt admission + Clear Street + mid-year denial + Sabrina BlackRock contrast, settles before trial. O&G involvement raises both settlement floor and ceiling. |
| Worst case | $1.5M - $3M+ | Sam Page corroborates, Platt admission admitted, 6 named targets located, national origin claim sticks, NYC jury. O&G's Rotondo experience makes this litigation highly efficient. |
| Catastrophic | $3M - $10M+ | Multiple Platt targets testify, class-action connection, FINRA referral, Sabrina testifies with BlackRock performance data as credibility armor |

## Immediate Actions

1. **URGENT: Coach Platt NOW -- Anthony is leaking plans.** Platt's team is openly discussing the CT strip on the desk. If CT is stripped from Sasha, it completes the exact Sam Page pattern and hands plaintiff's counsel a before/after exhibit. The window to prevent this is hours, not days.
2. **URGENT: Prepare for "stay and fight" scenario.** O&G told Sasha he can remain at Bloomberg while the case proceeds. This means every interaction between Platt and Sasha is now monitored by counsel in real time. PIP, coverage changes, meeting tone -- all become exhibits. Platt must be coached that Sasha is likely attorney-represented and everything said or written will be reviewed.
3. **Identify Anthony's full last name before plaintiff's team does.** He is now a two-incident witness. If subpoenaed, "does your wife work?" + "CT coverage to be seen if you catch my drift" form a devastating testimony pair.
4. **Investigate Ryan Ron, Bryan Stewart, John Calabro employment records immediately.** If any of these three experienced similar sequences under Platt (coverage strip, negative review, push-out), the pattern expands from 2-3 to 6+ and approaches systemic conduct. Pull their performance records, departure circumstances, and any HR complaints.
5. **Prepare for CT coverage stripping.** If Platt strips CT, document the legitimate business reason NOW, before it happens. If there is no legitimate reason, prevent the action.
6. **Attorney retention is effectively complete -- O&G is the frontrunner.** O&G at 35% with "very strong case" assessment and possible full litigation scope is the worst-case opposing counsel scenario for Bloomberg. They won the $5M JPMorgan Chase Rotondo settlement. Brief company legal team NOW if not already done.
7. **CRM audit logs for 9/5/2025** -- know what they show before subpoena.
8. **Personal counsel for manager** -- Platt admission, national origin allegations, forecast tampering, live evidence of account-stripping intent.
9. **Preserve all Bloomberg MSG data** -- exchanges are being screenshotted and forwarded to support team in real time.
10. **Prepare for Sabrina as a credible, high-impact witness.** Her BlackRock performance data (NYSTRS and GMO client praise within 5 months) makes the "she was a poor performer who left on her own" defense substantially harder to sell. If she testifies, Bloomberg cannot effectively impeach her performance credibility when third-party clients at a major competitor are praising her work.

## Latest Intelligence

- **O&G "very strong case" at 35% is the worst-case opposing counsel scenario.** Outten & Golden won the $5M Rotondo settlement. Nina's confident assessment and lower fee indicate they see a case worth fighting through trial. If they handle full litigation, Sasha gets better counsel at lower cost than Phillips. Decision expected after Monday March 2 call.
- **"Stay and fight" changes everything.** O&G told Sasha he can stay at Bloomberg and Bloomberg "might offer him more to leave." This is fundamentally different from Phillips' separation orientation. If Sasha stays, every management action is a live exhibit reviewed by O&G counsel in real time. The PIP, the March meeting, coverage decisions -- all become attorney-supervised events.
- **Sabrina is now a credible witness with third-party proof.** BlackRock client praise from NYSTRS and GMO within 5 months of leaving Platt's team. Same person Platt allegedly rated as underperforming. The "poor performer" credibility attack against Sabrina is substantially weakened. Her "Teddy can shove everything he was trying to do to me" is another contemporaneous, unprompted attribution of deliberate conduct.
- **Platt admission remains devastating.** "When I want to get rid of someone... I talk as much shit as I can" -- said directly to Sasha while pushing out Sam Page. Even uncorroborated (1:1), a jury hearing this quote alongside the documented pattern will find it credible.
- **Six named Platt targets.** Sam Page, Sasha, Ryan Ron, Bryan Stewart (~15 yrs), John Calabro, plus at least one more unnamed. If even two of these six corroborate the pattern, the case becomes near-unwinnable.
- **Anthony is a two-incident witness.** "Does your wife work?" (pre-eval, caregiver bias) + "CT coverage to be seen if you catch my drift" (real-time coverage stripping signal). Both incidents involve Sasha's protected status.
- **CT strip would complete the Sam Page pattern exactly.** Coverage strip during/after leave, negative review, territory reduction to zero, push-out. If it happens, plaintiff's counsel has a template case.
- **Pre-litigation window is rapidly closing.** Once Sasha signs with O&G (likely within days of March 2 call), a demand letter or agency filing could follow within 2-4 weeks. Bloomberg's window for proactive investigation and settlement positioning is measured in days.
