# Case Status Brief

**Last updated:** February 21, 2026

## Current Posture

**Phase:** Pre-litigation. No attorney retained yet.
**Next critical date:** Monday Feb 23 -- employee calls 5 plaintiff's firms (Cohen Milstein first, already suing Bloomberg). Attorney retention expected within days.
**Follow-up meeting with manager:** ~March 5-10.

## His Case: STRONG

The evaluation says he "can't improve" because of leave, then penalizes him for not improving. Coverage is 5.4x lower than the comparator who took short leave. He led the team in activity but was rated worst. Manager's statements tying decisions to leave are corroborated by multiple timestamped sources. Sam Page (if he cooperates) turns this from one incident into a pattern. Two consecutive leave-then-punishment cycles. All under NYCHRL's "motivating factor" standard with uncapped damages.

## Our Defense: MODERATE

**What works:** Qualitative deficiencies in the eval (adoptions, visit breadth, day structure). Employee's own "pulling back on effort" WhatsApp messages. His concession email on Feb 17. Mass layoffs provide partial comp cover. Key statements are challengeable as hearsay.

**What doesn't:** The evaluation contradicts itself on the page. Coverage disparity is from Bloomberg's own systems. No documented rationale for coverage decisions. Sam Page is uninvestigated. "Carried the baby" is facially discriminatory if Sabrina testifies. 52% target increase while coverage is lowest has no obvious explanation.

## Likely Outcomes

| Scenario | Range | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Best case | $200K - $400K | Sam Page clean, strong documentation, weaker counsel, pre-discovery settlement |
| Most likely | $500K - $1.5M | Competent counsel, survives summary judgment, settles before/during trial |
| Worst case | $1.5M - $3M+ | Sam Page corroborates, Sabrina testifies, NYC jury verdict with punitive damages |
| Catastrophic | $3M - $10M+ | Cohen Milstein connects to Ndugga class action, pattern finding |

## Personal Risk to You (the Manager)

**Individual liability:** Under NYCHRL, individual supervisors can be held personally liable as "aiders and abettors" of discriminatory conduct. You are not just a company witness -- you are a potential individual defendant. If Sasha names you personally, your interests and Bloomberg's may diverge. Bloomberg's lawyers represent Bloomberg, not you. You may need your own attorney.

**Deposition exposure:** You are the primary deposition target. Every attributed statement, every coverage decision, and every line of the evaluation flows through you. Plaintiff's counsel will have the full case file before they question you. A bad deposition performance -- evasiveness, hostility, contradictions with documented evidence -- can individually determine the outcome. See LITIGATION_PREP.md Section 5 for the 32 questions you will face.

**Career risk:** Regardless of litigation outcome, if Bloomberg's internal investigation confirms the pattern alleged, your position becomes untenable. Companies settle these cases and then deal with the manager separately. Being the manager at the center of a parental leave retaliation lawsuit -- especially one connected to an existing class action (Ndugga) -- creates reputational and professional exposure that extends beyond this job.

**Forecast tampering allegation (NEW -- Feb 21):** Sasha is claiming you deleted his largest sales forecast and reopened it under your own name. He says he has photos. His team flagged FINRA implications. If this is true, it is catastrophic for you personally -- it's not a management judgment call, it's potential revenue fraud, and it gives the plaintiff a motive narrative (suppressed his numbers, then rated him as underperforming). If it's false, Bloomberg's forecast system audit logs will prove that and it dies. Either way, you need to know what those logs show before anyone else pulls them. This is the single most urgent item in this document.

**Criminal/regulatory risk:** The civil litigation itself carries no criminal exposure. But if the forecast tampering allegation is substantiated, it could create separate regulatory risk (FINRA, internal compliance) that is personal to you, not to Bloomberg. Document destruction, witness tampering, or altering records would also create criminal exposure. Do not touch anything.

**What to do:** Retain your own employment attorney (separate from Bloomberg's counsel) for personal advice. Do this before Monday. Bloomberg's defense team will prep you as a company witness, but their obligation is to the company, not to you. If settlement discussions involve concessions about your conduct, or if the forecast allegation creates a conflict between your interests and Bloomberg's, you need independent counsel looking out for you.

## What to Do Now

1. **Litigation hold** -- preserve all records (employee, Sam Page, Sabrina, Johnston, full team) back to Jan 2018
2. **Retain defense counsel** -- before Monday if possible; employee is targeting 5 top-tier firms
3. **Investigate Sam Page** -- his file is the single biggest variable in the case
4. **Pull comparative data** -- team-wide targets, coverage history, evaluations, comp outcomes
5. **Coach manager (through counsel)** -- no leave references, no contact with former employees, no document changes
6. **Prepare for March meeting** -- script responses to coverage/target questions in advance
7. **Defer PIP** -- at least until Q3 2026; implementing now confirms the employee's predicted playbook

## Latest Intelligence (Feb 21)

New file `Monday_Playbook.md`: operational attorney outreach playbook with scripted calls, recording instructions (one-party consent), and mandatory upfront disclosure of the WhatsApp "effort" messages to all firms. Cohen Milstein is the lead target. Five firms total (up from 3). The support team has moved from planning to execution.

**NEW ALLEGATION (Feb 21) -- FORECAST TAMPERING (against you personally):** Employee's CASE_STATUS.md claims you deleted his largest sales forecast and reopened it under your own name. He says photos exist. His team flagged FINRA implications and told him not to report until attorney advises (i.e., they're holding it as leverage). This was not in any prior evidence file -- it surfaced very recently and is still marked "unconfirmed" on their end. **You need to determine immediately: (a) did this happen, (b) what do the system audit logs show, and (c) is there a legitimate business explanation.** If the logs are clean, this allegation dies. If they're not, this becomes the most dangerous element of the entire case -- worse than the evaluation, worse than Sam Page -- because it's fraud, not a judgment call.
