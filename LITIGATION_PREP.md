## Section 1: Anticipated Legal Theories

### Theory 1: FMLA Retaliation (29 U.S.C. Section 2615(a)(2))

**Statutory Basis:** The Family and Medical Leave Act prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise FMLA rights. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the employee must show: (1) he exercised a right under the FMLA; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; (3) there is a causal connection between the exercise of the right and the adverse action.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- **Element 1 (Exercise of FMLA right):** Undisputed. Two six-month parental leaves (Nov 2023 - May 2024; Jul 2025 - Dec 2025). Bloomberg's own records confirm both.
- **Element 2 (Adverse employment action):** Multiple: (a) negative performance evaluations in both cycles; (b) 0% raise after first leave; (c) no raise, no bonus after second leave; (d) PIP threat; (e) coverage stripping (territories removed, not restored, excluded from redistribution); (f) revenue target increased 52% while coverage reduced. Each independently qualifies as an adverse action; collectively they are overwhelming.
- **Element 3 (Causal connection):** The mid-year evaluation explicitly references the leave. The year-end evaluation opens with the leave. The manager admitted he ranked the employee low because he "thought [he] was gonna quit" during leave. The manager said "we didn't cut your pay and you were away for 6 months." The temporal proximity -- adverse actions within weeks of each return from leave, twice -- supports an inference of causation. Two firing "jokes" linked to leave. The coverage disparity maps to leave duration (5.4x gap between full-leave and short-leave employees).

**Company's Strongest Defense:** After the prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason. The company's position is that the evaluation reflected genuine performance concerns: low revenue, insufficient client visits, poor strategic adoptions, shortened days, failure to adopt prior feedback. The burden then shifts back to the employee to show pretext. The company's best argument is that the specific qualitative deficiencies cited in the evaluation (CT visit breadth, day length, adoption quality) are objectively documented and distinguish this from a simple volume comparison. The company should also argue that mentioning leave in the evaluation was contextual (explaining why full-year data was unavailable), not retaliatory.

**Key Risk:** The pretext analysis is where this theory becomes dangerous. The employee can show: the counter-metrics (648 interactions, team leader, 139% prorated revenue) directly contradict the evaluation's characterization; the mid-year evaluation acknowledged the employee "can't do much to improve" because of leave and then penalized him for not improving; coverage was stripped and never restored while the target was raised; two consecutive leave-then-punishment cycles; the Sam Page pattern. Under the Second Circuit's pretext framework, these facts create a genuine issue of material fact that will survive summary judgment.

**Statute of Limitations:** Three years for willful violations under the FMLA. The earliest alleged adverse actions (coverage stripping during first leave, ~Nov 2023 - May 2024) fall within the window. All subsequent actions are well within the period.

---

### Theory 2: FMLA Interference (29 U.S.C. Section 2615(a)(1))

**Statutory Basis:** It is unlawful for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of FMLA rights. Interference claims do not require proof of discriminatory intent -- only that the employer's actions denied the employee benefits to which he was entitled.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- **Job posting during leave (Jul 2025):** The employee screenshotted a non-temporary job posting for his team while he was on parental leave. If this posting was for his position (or substantially similar), it constitutes interference because it signals the employer does not intend to restore the employee to his position upon return -- a core FMLA entitlement.
- **Mandatory review scheduled during leave (Jun 2025):** The manager scheduled a mandatory in-person review for August 8, 2025, knowing the employee would be on leave. While the manager said he'd "check with HR" when the employee pointed out the conflict, the act of scheduling it creates evidence of interference with the uninterrupted exercise of leave.
- **Coverage stripping as de facto demotion upon return:** FMLA requires restoration to the same or equivalent position. If the employee returned to a role with substantially diminished coverage (1,138 firms vs. pre-leave levels, territories removed), this may constitute a failure to restore to an equivalent position. The position title may be the same, but the revenue-generating capacity was dramatically reduced.

**Company's Strongest Defense:** (a) The job posting was for additional headcount, not a replacement -- the team was down three members (Baptist departed, Sabrina departed, employee on leave). (b) The mandatory review was a calendar oversight corrected when flagged. (c) The employee was restored to the same position with the same title, salary, and reporting structure; coverage adjustments are routine business decisions, not FMLA interference.

**Key Risk:** The "equivalent position" argument is the strongest interference claim. If the employee's pre-leave coverage universe was substantially larger than 1,138 firms, and it was reduced during leave and not restored, a reasonable jury could find the restored position was not equivalent. Discovery will establish the pre-leave coverage baseline.

### Theory 3: NYCHRL Caregiver Status Discrimination (NYC Admin Code Section 8-107)

**Statutory Basis:** The New York City Human Rights Law prohibits discrimination based on "caregiver status," defined as being a parent or person with childcare obligations. NYC amended the NYCHRL in 2016 to add this as a protected class. The NYCHRL uses a "motivating factor" standard -- the employee need only show that caregiver status was a motivating factor in the adverse action, not the sole or even primary factor. Summary judgment is disfavored. The NYCHRL is construed independently of its federal and state counterparts and always in favor of broader protections.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- **Leave-based adverse actions:** Every adverse action documented in the case file -- negative evaluations, zero compensation, coverage stripping, PIP threat, target increase -- directly follows the exercise of caregiver responsibilities (taking parental leave to care for a newborn).
- **Manager's statements demonstrate caregiver animus:** "Thought he was quitting" (penalizing leave speculation); "we didn't cut your pay and you were away for 6 months" (linking compensation to leave duration); "anybody that does 6 months he hates if a male" (employee's characterization); firing "jokes" about taking full leave; the "carried the baby" comment (via Sabrina); statement about Corey Levine's promotion being blocked because he "took six months off."
- **Coverage disparity maps to leave duration:** Sasha (6 months leave, 1,138 firms) vs. Johnston (1 month leave, 6,099 firms). The variable is not job performance -- it is the duration of caregiver leave.
- **Peer recognition:** A colleague's comment -- "that's what happens when you have a kid" -- demonstrates the workplace recognizes caregiver-based retaliation.
- **WFH denied for sick child (Jun 2025):** Direct denial of accommodation for a caregiver obligation.

**Company's Strongest Defense:** The adverse actions were based on legitimate, documented performance deficiencies that exist independently of caregiver status. The coverage disparity reflects business decisions about territory management, not caregiver discrimination. The manager's statements are being taken out of context. Bloomberg's parental leave policy is generous and gender-neutral, demonstrating institutional commitment to caregiver rights even if individual managerial comments were inartful.

**Key Risk:** NYCHRL is the single most dangerous theory. The "motivating factor" standard means even if performance concerns were genuine, the presence of caregiver animus as one factor among several creates liability. Summary judgment is almost never granted under NYCHRL in cases with this volume of circumstantial evidence. Compensatory damages are uncapped. Attorney's fees shift to the prevailing plaintiff. A New York City jury will be sympathetic to a father punished for caring for his children. This is the theory most likely to reach a jury and most likely to produce a substantial verdict.

**Additional Risk -- Retaliation Cascade Theory *(Added Feb 21 evening):*** The employee's team has articulated a "Retaliation Cascade" legal theory (their Section F) arguing that Bloomberg cannot use the consequences of Cycle 1 retaliation to justify Cycle 2 adverse actions. If the 0% raise in Feb 2025 was retaliatory, and the employee's reduced effort was a response to that retaliation, then the reduced effort cannot be cited as a legitimate basis for the 2025-2026 evaluation. Under NYCHRL's "motivating factor" standard, this chain argument has legal force. It directly neutralizes the defense's strongest weapon -- the WhatsApp "doing it on purpose" admissions -- by reframing the employee's disengagement as a consequence of retaliation rather than an independent performance problem. The defense must break this chain at the first link by demonstrating the 0% raise was legitimate.

**Statute of Limitations:** Three years under NYCHRL for filing in court (one year for filing with NYC Commission on Human Rights, but this is not a prerequisite). All alleged adverse actions from 2023 forward are within the window.

### Theory 4: NYCHRL Gender Discrimination (NYC Admin Code Section 8-107, via Price Waterhouse Gender Stereotyping)

**Statutory Basis:** The NYCHRL prohibits discrimination based on gender. Under the Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins framework (incorporated into NYCHRL's broader protections), gender stereotyping -- treating a male employee differently because he does not conform to gender expectations about caregiving roles -- constitutes gender discrimination. A male employee punished for taking extended parental leave because his manager believes caregiving is a woman's responsibility states a gender discrimination claim.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- **"He shouldn't be taking primary leave for 6 months because it's not like he carried the baby."** This is a textbook gender stereotype. The manager distinguishes between the mother (who "carried the baby") and the father (who did not) and concludes the father should not take equivalent leave. This treats parental leave as gendered -- mothers deserve it, fathers do not.
- **"Anybody that does 6 months he hates if a male."** The employee's own characterization, in a contemporaneous WhatsApp message, explicitly identifies the gender dimension: the manager's hostility is specifically toward male employees who take extended leave.
- **Corey Levine statement:** The manager said Levine would not become a manager because he took six months off. Levine is male. The manager's view that extended leave disqualifies male employees from advancement is gender stereotyping.
- **Johnston comparator:** Johnston (male, short leave) is favored over the employee (male, long leave). While both are male, the gender discrimination theory operates through stereotyping about what fathers should do -- taking full leave is coded as non-masculine or as improperly assuming a "maternal" role.

**Company's Strongest Defense:** (a) The "carried the baby" comment is reported through Sabrina, a former employee with her own grievances -- hearsay, potentially biased, and the manager can deny it. (b) Bloomberg's policy is gender-neutral; both mothers and fathers receive the same leave entitlement. The company's institutional posture is non-discriminatory. (c) The manager's treatment of other male employees who took shorter leave (Johnston) shows he does not discriminate against men generally -- only against underperformance.

**Key Risk:** If Sabrina testifies credibly, the "carried the baby" comment is devastating under NYCHRL. It is facially discriminatory and cannot be explained as a business judgment. It opens a separate damages theory (gender discrimination on top of caregiver/leave retaliation) and potentially broader discovery into the manager's treatment of all male employees who took parental leave.

---

### Theory 5: NYCHRL Retaliation for Protected Activity (NYC Admin Code Section 8-107(7))

**Statutory Basis:** The NYCHRL prohibits retaliation against employees who oppose discriminatory practices, file complaints, or testify in proceedings. If the employee files an internal complaint with HR, files with the NYC Commission on Human Rights, or retains an attorney and sends a demand letter, any subsequent adverse action triggers a retaliation claim with a very low threshold.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- This theory is not yet active because the employee has not filed a complaint or engaged in any formal protected activity. However, the employee's support team has discussed filing with the NYC Commission on Human Rights, contacting the NY State Division of Human Rights, and retaining an attorney.
- **Once the employee takes any of these steps, every subsequent adverse action -- including implementing a PIP -- becomes potential retaliation for protected activity.** This is separate from the leave retaliation claims and creates an additional layer of liability.

**Company's Strongest Defense:** Any adverse action following a complaint must be shown to have been in the works before the complaint was made. If the PIP was already discussed in the evaluation (February 2026) and the complaint is filed in March 2026, the company can argue the PIP was a continuation of a pre-existing performance management process, not retaliation for the complaint.

**Key Risk:** The timing of any PIP or further adverse action after the employee files a complaint is critical. Even a pre-planned PIP implemented shortly after a complaint will create an inference of retaliation. The company must document the PIP decision chain with dates that pre-date the complaint.

---

### Theory 6: New York State Paid Family Leave Retaliation (Workers' Compensation Law Section 203-a)

**Statutory Basis:** New York's Paid Family Leave law prohibits employers from discriminating or retaliating against employees who request or take PFL. Complaints are filed with the Workers' Compensation Board. The employer may not deny any right, privilege, or benefit to an employee because they exercised PFL rights.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- All the same evidence supporting the FMLA retaliation theory applies. The employee took PFL-eligible leave twice and suffered adverse consequences both times.
- This statute specifically covers bonding leave for a new child, which is exactly what the employee took.

**Company's Strongest Defense:** The same as FMLA retaliation -- legitimate, non-retaliatory performance basis for all adverse actions.

**Key Risk:** NY PFL complaints are investigated by the Workers' Compensation Board, which can impose penalties independent of any civil lawsuit. A PFL complaint is relatively easy to file and creates a parallel proceeding that generates additional discovery and publicity.

---

### Theory 7: Title VII Gender Stereotyping (42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-2, via Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins)

**Statutory Basis:** Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, including discrimination based on gender stereotypes. A male employee penalized for assuming a caregiving role stereotypically assigned to women states a claim under Title VII's gender stereotyping theory. An EEOC charge must be filed as a prerequisite.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- The "carried the baby" comment is the anchor. It distinguishes between the birthing parent and the non-birthing parent and treats extended leave as appropriate only for the former.
- The pattern of penalizing full (six-month) leave while accepting short (one-month) leave, when Bloomberg's policy treats both equally, suggests the manager applied a gendered standard to leave-taking.

**Company's Strongest Defense:** (a) Title VII requires filing an EEOC charge within 300 days (with state agency cross-filing). Some earlier adverse actions may be time-barred. (b) The "carried the baby" comment is hearsay and may be challenged at the EEOC investigation stage. (c) Bloomberg's policy is facially neutral, and company-wide data may show that many fathers take full leave without adverse consequences, isolating this as one manager's issue rather than an institutional pattern.

**Key Risk:** Title VII claims permit recovery of compensatory and punitive damages (capped at $300,000 for employers with 500+ employees). More importantly, an EEOC charge triggers an EEOC investigation that could expand beyond this individual employee. If the EEOC decides to investigate Bloomberg's treatment of parental leave-takers broadly, the exposure multiplies.

---

### Theory 8: New York State Human Rights Law (Executive Law Section 296)

**Statutory Basis:** The NYSHRL prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, familial status, and retaliation for opposing discriminatory practices. As of 2019 amendments, the NYSHRL standard has been liberalized to align more closely with NYCHRL, though NYCHRL remains broader. Uncapped damages are available.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- All evidence supporting the NYCHRL claims applies equally to the NYSHRL. The employee can file both.
- "Familial status" is a protected class under NYSHRL, directly applicable to an employee punished for parental leave associated with a new child.

**Company's Strongest Defense:** Same as NYCHRL theories, but with slightly more room for summary judgment under NYSHRL compared to NYCHRL (though post-2019 amendments narrowed this gap).

**Key Risk:** Running NYSHRL in parallel with NYCHRL allows the employee to present the same evidence under two legal frameworks to a jury, maximizing the probability that at least one theory produces liability.

## Section 2: Discovery Anticipation

### 2.1 Document Requests (Anticipated from Plaintiff's Attorney)

The following requests should be anticipated. For each, an assessment of how damaging the produced materials will be is provided.

**Request 1: All performance evaluations, reviews, and assessments of Aleksandr Akulov from January 2019 through the present.**

- **Damage Assessment: HIGH.** The 2025 evaluations are the core of the plaintiff's case and are already in his possession. Earlier evaluations showing strong performance will establish the pre-leave baseline and create a before/after narrative. If the employee was rated highly before his first leave and rated low only afterward, the temporal pattern is established through Bloomberg's own records.
- **Privilege:** None. Standard business records. Must be produced.

**Request 2: All performance evaluations, reviews, and assessments of every member of the ETS-Listed AMER South team for 2024 and 2025.**

- **Damage Assessment: HIGH.** This reveals how the employee's evaluation compares to peers. If peers with comparable or worse metrics received better evaluations, the pretextual nature of the employee's evaluation is demonstrated. If peers on the same team who did not take leave received raises, the disparate treatment is documented.
- **Privilege:** None. May require redaction of other employees' personal information, but the substance must be produced.

**Request 3: All documents relating to the assignment, reassignment, or modification of coverage territories, client accounts, or firm assignments for Aleksandr Akulov from January 2023 through the present.**

- **Damage Assessment: CRITICAL.** This is the request that will produce the coverage stripping evidence from the company's own systems. It will show when Houston and upstate NY were removed, when they were not restored, who received them, and how the Baptist redistribution was conducted. If there is no contemporaneous documentation of the business rationale for each change, the inference of retaliation is unimpeded.
- **Privilege:** None unless coverage decisions were made in consultation with counsel (highly unlikely for routine territory changes).

**Request 4: All documents relating to coverage territory assignments for all members of the ETS-Listed AMER South team from January 2023 through the present, including but not limited to the coverage universe spreadsheet or database showing firm counts by team member.**

- **Damage Assessment: CRITICAL.** This produces the comparative coverage data. The 1,138 vs. 6,099 disparity will be shown across time, revealing when the gap developed and how it correlates to leave periods. If the gap widened after each leave, the setup-to-fail narrative is established with Bloomberg's own data.
- **Privilege:** None.

**Request 5: All documents relating to revenue targets, quotas, or goals for Aleksandr Akulov and all members of his team for 2024, 2025, and 2026.**

- **Damage Assessment: POTENTIALLY CRITICAL.** If the employee's 52% target increase was unique or disproportionate compared to peers, this is devastating. If the increase was team-wide, it mitigates the allegation. This request will definitively answer the question.
- **Privilege:** None.

**Request 6: All documents relating to compensation decisions (base salary changes, bonuses, incentive payments) for Aleksandr Akulov and all members of his team for 2024, 2025, and 2026, including any committee recommendations, manager recommendations, and approval records.**

- **Damage Assessment: HIGH.** This reveals whether the employee was uniquely disadvantaged or whether austerity was broad. It also reveals the compensation decision chain -- who recommended, who approved, and what rationale was documented.
- **Privilege:** Potential attorney-client privilege if legal counsel was consulted during the compensation decision. Unlikely for routine compensation unless this employee was specifically flagged.

**Request 7: The complete employment file of Sam Page, including all evaluations, PIPs, disciplinary actions, separation agreement, and exit documentation.**

- **Damage Assessment: POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING.** If Page's file mirrors the pattern the employee describes (leave followed by negative evaluation, coverage stripping, PIP, termination), this is the single most damaging production in the case. If Page's file shows a well-documented, pre-leave performance decline with contemporaneous records, it becomes a defense asset.
- **Privilege:** Page's employment records are not privileged. Any separation agreement with a release may be produced (the confidentiality clause may apply to Page's disclosure obligations, not to the company's obligation to produce it in litigation).

**Request 8: All documents relating to the hiring, transfer, or recruitment of personnel for the ETS-Listed AMER South team from June 2025 through January 2026, including job postings, requisition approvals, and interview records.**

- **Damage Assessment: HIGH.** This covers the job posting during the employee's leave. It will show whether the posting was for the employee's role, a different role, or additional headcount. The requisition approval will reveal the business rationale (or lack thereof).
- **Privilege:** None.

**Request 9: All communications (email, instant message, text, chat) between the manager and any Bloomberg HR representative concerning Aleksandr Akulov from January 2023 through the present.**

- **Damage Assessment: VARIABLE.** Could contain helpful context (manager consulting HR appropriately on performance management) or damaging admissions (manager expressing frustration about leave). The content is unknown. Must be produced.
- **Privilege:** Communications with HR are generally not privileged unless in-house counsel was specifically included for the purpose of providing legal advice.

**Request 10: All communications (email, instant message, text, chat) between the manager and any person concerning Aleksandr Akulov's parental leave, leave status, return from leave, or leave duration from January 2023 through the present.**

- **Damage Assessment: UNPREDICTABLE.** If the manager expressed frustration about the leave in writing to anyone -- a peer, his own manager, HR -- this is devastating. If no such communications exist, the absence helps the defense. The employee's team has attributed multiple verbal statements to the manager; any written corroboration of those sentiments would be catastrophic.
- **Privilege:** None unless counsel was involved.

**Request 11: Bloomberg's parental leave policy, FMLA policy, and any guidance documents provided to managers regarding administration of leave and evaluation of employees who have taken extended leave.**

- **Damage Assessment: MODERATE.** If Bloomberg has clear guidance requiring prorating or prohibiting leave-period performance penalization and the manager deviated from it, this proves policy violation. If no such guidance exists, this is a systemic gap that helps neither side exclusively but undermines the "following policy" defense.
- **Privilege:** None.

**Request 12: All documents relating to any employee of Bloomberg LP who took parental leave of four months or longer under the same manager from January 2018 through the present, including evaluations, coverage changes, compensation decisions, and separation documentation.**

- **Damage Assessment: POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING.** This is the pattern-and-practice request. It will capture Sam Page, the employee, and any other leave-takers under this manager. If there is a consistent pattern of adverse outcomes for extended-leave employees, the case transforms from individual to systemic.
- **Privilege:** None.

**Request 13: All 180-degree management reviews or upward feedback submitted by direct reports of the manager from January 2020 through the present.**

- **Damage Assessment: VARIABLE.** If other direct reports identified hostility toward leave, micromanagement, or double standards in their reviews of the manager, this corroborates the employee's account. The employee himself mentioned regretting not writing a 180 review.
- **Privilege:** Depends on Bloomberg's characterization of these reviews. Some companies protect peer/upward reviews as privileged management communications. Likely discoverable over objection.

**Request 14 (Added Feb 21): The complete CRM audit trail for all forecast records associated with Aleksandr Akulov for the period August 1 - October 31, 2025, including but not limited to: creation timestamps, modification timestamps, user IDs of all modifiers, field-level change logs, status changes (including "duplicate" closures), and all associated notes or comments before and after modification.**

- **Damage Assessment: BINARY -- ranges from EXONERATING to DEVASTATING.** The employee alleges the manager closed a ~$58K forecast as "dupe" on 9/5/2025, stripped notes, and reopened the same day. If the audit trail shows routine CRM maintenance (consolidating a genuine duplicate, correcting a data entry), this allegation collapses and the employee's credibility is damaged. If it confirms the employee's account, this is potentially the most dangerous single piece of evidence in the case: it provides a concrete motive narrative (suppress his numbers, then rate him as underperforming) and creates FINRA regulatory exposure for the manager's Series 24 license.
- **Privilege:** None. Standard business records. Must be produced.
- **ACTION REQUIRED: Pull this audit trail NOW, before discovery is demanded. The company needs to know what these logs show before anyone else does.**

**Request 15 (Added Feb 21): Sabrina Sparapani's complete HR exit interview notes, including any written documentation, interviewer's notes, typed summaries, or electronic records of her exit interview conducted in approximately July 2025.**

- **Damage Assessment: VARIABLE -- could be LOW or HIGH depending on content.** Sabrina told the plaintiff she was "veeeerrrry honest" in her exit interview about the manager's conduct. If the notes contain specific complaints about leave-based retaliation, they establish that Bloomberg HR had institutional knowledge of the alleged pattern. If the notes are generic (standard complaints about management style without specifics about leave), the institutional knowledge argument is substantially weaker. The actual content is unknown.
- **Privilege:** Exit interview notes are generally not privileged unless conducted at the direction of counsel for the purpose of providing legal advice. Standard HR exit interviews are discoverable.
- **ACTION REQUIRED: Pull these notes now. Bloomberg needs to know what they contain before discovery.**

**Request 16 (Added Feb 21): All communications between Rich Santore and the manager, and between Rich Santore and any HR representative, concerning Aleksandr Akulov, his performance, his parental leave, or his evaluation, from January 2023 through the present.**

- **Damage Assessment: VARIABLE.** If Santore expressed concerns about the evaluation or the employee's treatment and the manager disregarded them, this helps the defense (shows institutional pushback). If Santore expressed agreement with or indifference to leave-related adverse actions, it creates co-liability and undermines the "one bad manager" defense. If Santore's communications are clean, his presence at the evaluation can be characterized as standard oversight.
- **Privilege:** Same as Request 9 -- not privileged unless counsel was specifically involved.

**Request 17 (Added Feb 21 evening): All GDSF forecast records for all members of the ETS-Listed AMER South team for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025, including forecast creation dates, amounts, stages, product types, and the methodology used to count "booked" forecasts in performance evaluations.**

- **Damage Assessment: POTENTIALLY HIGH.** The employee claims 4 GDSF forecasts totaling $50,300 with specific CRM IDs (#1398757, #1409461, #1393077, plus one additional), but the evaluation characterized his production as "only 1 GDSF forecast booked ($26,300)." If the team-wide data shows the manager counted all stages of forecasts for other team members but applied a narrower definition to the employee, this establishes selective data presentation. If the counting methodology was consistent across the team, the defense has an explanation. Either way, this data will be subpoenaed and the defense needs to understand it first.
- **Privilege:** None. Standard business records. Must be produced.
- **ACTION REQUIRED: Pull this data now. The employee has specific forecast IDs -- the defense must verify what those IDs represent before an attorney subpoenas them.**

**Request 19 (Added Feb 23): All documents relating to Bryan Baptist's employment at Bloomberg, including evaluations, coverage assignments, departure documentation, and any complaints filed by or about him.**

- **Damage Assessment: POTENTIALLY HIGH.** Baptist is the second alleged national origin discrimination target. His employment file may reveal whether any complaints were made about the "Rahul" misnaming, how his coverage was redistributed (and why the employee was excluded), and the circumstances of his departure. If Baptist was a strong performer who left voluntarily, his departure and the coverage redistribution create a coverage-stripping narrative. If complaints about the manager exist in his file, Bloomberg had additional institutional notice.
- **Privilege:** None. Standard employment records.
- **ACTION REQUIRED: Review Baptist's file now. Understand what it contains before the plaintiff's attorney contacts Baptist.**

**Request 20 (Added Feb 23): All documents relating to Bloomberg's anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training, including completion records for the manager, training materials, and any guidance specifically addressing national origin discrimination, ethnic stereotyping, or the use of nicknames or informal names in the workplace.**

- **Damage Assessment: VARIABLE.** If the manager completed training that specifically addressed ethnic stereotyping and then continued using "Comrade" and "Rahul," the training records prove he knew the behavior was wrong. If no training addressed this topic, Bloomberg has a gap that undermines institutional defense. If the manager skipped training, it demonstrates negligence.
- **Privilege:** None. Standard HR records.

**Request 18 (Added Feb 21 evening): All documents relating to Bloomberg's stack ranking or calibration sessions for the ETS-Listed AMER South team and any cross-team ranking sessions that included Aleksandr Akulov, including meeting notes, written rankings, manager justifications, and any dissents or questions raised about rankings, from January 2023 through the present.**

- **Damage Assessment: VARIABLE.** The employee's team has identified that Bloomberg uses a collective stack ranking process where managers convene and rank employees across teams, with all managers seeing all rankings. If these sessions are documented (and at Bloomberg, they likely are), the records will show what justification the manager gave for ranking the employee at the bottom. If the stated justification referenced leave, absence, or anything that could be construed as leave-related, this is direct evidence of retaliatory animus in a formal management setting. If the justification was purely performance-based and leave-neutral, this helps the defense.
- **Privilege:** Likely not privileged unless counsel was present. Standard business process documentation.
- **ACTION REQUIRED: Determine what documentation exists from these sessions and preserve it under the litigation hold.**

### 2.2 Interrogatories (Anticipated)

1. Identify all employees under the manager's direct supervision who took parental leave of four or more months since January 2018, and for each, state the leave duration, pre-leave evaluation rating, post-leave evaluation rating, and any subsequent PIP or separation.
2. State the business rationale for each change in Aleksandr Akulov's coverage territory since January 2023, identifying who made the decision, when it was made, and what factors were considered.
3. Identify the methodology used to set Aleksandr Akulov's 2026 revenue target of $175,000, including who set it, what data was used, and how it compares to the target-setting methodology for his peers.
4. State whether any person involved in the evaluation or compensation decisions for Aleksandr Akulov in 2025 or 2026 was aware of his parental leave status at the time of making those decisions.
5. Identify all persons involved in the decision to deny Aleksandr Akulov a raise and bonus in February 2026, including each person's role in the decision and the documented basis for their recommendation.

### 2.3 Depositions (Anticipated)

Plaintiff's counsel will seek to depose at minimum:

1. **The Manager** -- Primary target. Evaluated the employee, made coverage decisions, made attributed statements. Every allegation flows through him.
2. **The Manager's Manager** -- Present at the Feb 17, 2026 meeting. Approved or acquiesced to the evaluation and compensation decisions. Will be asked what he knew and whether he reviewed the evaluation for bias.
3. **HR Representative(s)** -- Whoever was involved in the evaluation process, compensation approval, and leave administration. Will be asked about Bloomberg's policies, whether they raised any concerns about evaluating a leave-taker this way, and whether the manager consulted them.
4. **James Johnston** -- Comparator. Will be asked about his coverage, performance, leave duration, and whether the manager ever made comments about leave duration or parental obligations.
5. **Sam Page** -- If located and willing. Will be asked about his leave, coverage stripping, PIP, and separation. His testimony is the make-or-break for the pattern claim.
6. **Sabrina** -- Will be asked about the "carried the baby" comment, her own departure, and the manager's general attitude toward leave-takers.
7. **Corey Levine** -- Will be asked about the manager's statement that his promotion was blocked because he took six months off.
8. **Bloomberg HR Director or 30(b)(6) Designee** -- Corporate representative deposition on topics including leave policy, evaluation standards for leave-takers, coverage assignment methodology, anti-harassment training, and any prior complaints about the manager.
9. *(Added Feb 23)* **Bryan Baptist** -- Will be asked about the "Rahul" misnaming, the manager's use of "Comrade" with the employee, coverage redistribution when he left (and the employee's exclusion), and general observations about the manager's treatment of team members.

### 2.4 Electronic Discovery

**Systems to be searched:**

- Bloomberg internal email (all custodians listed in Section 3)
- Bloomberg instant messaging / chat system (if one exists)
- Bloomberg MSG (internal messaging system) *(Added Feb 24)* -- specifically the manager's MSG history with the employee and all team members. The Feb 24 Clear Street exchange is timestamped and stored in this system. All MSG threads between Platt and Sasha from Jan 2023 to present must be preserved.
- Bloomberg HR information system (evaluations, compensation records, PIP documentation)
- Bloomberg CRM / coverage assignment system
- Bloomberg recruiting system (job postings, requisitions)
- Bloomberg performance management portal
- Manager's personal devices (if Bloomberg brings a BYOD counterclaim or if the manager used personal devices for work communications)

**Date ranges:** January 2018 through the present. The extended date range is necessary to capture Sam Page's tenure, the manager's full management history, and baseline evaluation data.

**Search terms (anticipated):**

- "Akulov" or "Alex" (in context of the employee) or "Sasha"
- "parental leave" or "paternity leave" or "PFL" or "FMLA"
- "Sam Page" or "Page"
- "coverage" combined with "reassign" or "territory" or "strip" or "remove"
- "PIP" or "performance improvement"
- "fired" or "fire" or "terminate" combined with "leave" or "paternity"
- "baby" or "pregnant" or "pregnancy" or "carried"
- "six months" or "6 months"
- *(Added Feb 23)* "Comrade" (in any context involving the employee)
- *(Added Feb 23)* "Rahul" (in any context involving Bryan Baptist)
- *(Added Feb 23)* "Baptist" or "Bryan Baptist"
- *(Added Feb 23)* "nickname" or "name" combined with "Russian" or "Indian"
- *(Added Feb 24)* "Clear Street" or "clear street"
- *(Added Feb 24)* "Tommy" (in context of account assignment or reassignment)
- *(Added Feb 24)* "assign" or "reassign" combined with employee name or account names

## Section 3: Document Preservation (Litigation Hold)

### 3.1 Immediate Preservation Requirements

A litigation hold must be issued immediately. The employee's case file reveals active attorney consultation targeting firms that specialize in this exact type of case. Filing is imminent within weeks to months. The duty to preserve attaches when litigation is reasonably anticipated, which is now.

### 3.2 Custodians Who Must Receive the Hold Notice

| Custodian | Role | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| The Manager | Direct supervisor, decision-maker | Central to every allegation. All communications, documents, notes, and evaluations he has created or received regarding the employee and any other leave-taking employee. |
| The Manager's Manager | Senior supervisor, present at Feb 17 meeting | Approved or acquiesced to evaluation and compensation decisions. Any communications about the employee's performance, leave, or coverage. |
| HR Business Partner(s) for ETS-Listed AMER South | HR support | Involved in evaluation review, compensation approval, leave administration, any complaints. |
| Bloomberg HR/Legal (Leave Administration) | Institutional | Parental leave policy, leave records, any guidance to managers about evaluating leave-takers. |
| Recruiting/Talent Acquisition | Institutional | Job posting records, requisitions for the employee's team during his leave. |

| James Johnston | Team member, comparator | His evaluations, coverage history, and compensation are directly at issue. |
| Sam Page (employment records) | Former employee | His entire employment file must be preserved. He does not need to receive a hold notice personally (he no longer works there), but his records must be flagged in all systems. |
| Sabrina (employment records) | Former employee | Same as above. Her departure circumstances and any complaints she filed are relevant. **Updated Feb 21: Include her HR exit interview notes specifically. Her iMessage statements claim she complained about the manager during that interview.** |
| **Rich Santore** *(Added Feb 21)* | **Manager's manager, present at Feb 17 evaluation** | **All communications with the manager regarding the employee, regarding Sabrina, regarding leave policies. His review/approval of evaluations. Any communications about the employee's coverage or compensation. Particularly: any awareness of Sabrina's exit interview complaints.** |
| **Bryan Baptist (employment records)** *(Added Feb 23)* | **Former employee** | **His employment file, evaluations, coverage assignments, departure documentation, and any complaints. Specifically: any record of the "Rahul" misnaming or any related complaint. His coverage redistribution records (who received his accounts and why the employee was excluded).** |
| Any Bloomberg employee who participated in coverage assignment, territory redistribution, or target-setting decisions | Various | Their records of those decisions and any communications about them. |
| **CRM/Sales Operations Administrator** *(Added Feb 21)* | **Technical** | **CRM audit trail records, forecast modification logs, user access logs for the GDSF system. Specifically: all records related to forecast modifications for the employee's accounts around 9/5/2025.** |
| **Bloomberg MSG System Administrator** *(Added Feb 24)* | **Technical** | **All MSG threads involving the manager with the employee and all team members. The MSG system contains timestamped, enterprise-stored exchanges that are now active evidence. Specifically: Feb 24, 2026 Clear Street exchange.** |

### 3.3 Systems to Preserve

| System | What to Preserve | Date Range |
|---|---|---|
| Bloomberg Email (internal) | All email to, from, cc, or bcc for all custodians involving the employee, leave topics, coverage decisions, PIPs, and Sam Page | Jan 2018 - present |
| Bloomberg Instant Messaging / Chat | Same scope as email | Jan 2018 - present |
| HR Information System (HRIS) | Evaluations, compensation records, PIP records, disciplinary records, leave records for: the employee, Sam Page, Sabrina, Johnston, all team members | Jan 2018 - present |
| Performance Management Portal | All evaluations written by the manager for any direct report | Jan 2018 - present |
| Coverage Assignment System / CRM | All territory assignments, client assignments, firm-count data, and changes for the ETS-Listed AMER South team | Jan 2018 - present |
| Recruiting System | All requisitions, postings, and hiring records for the ETS-Listed AMER South team | Jun 2025 - present |
| Calendar System | Manager's calendar entries for meetings with the employee, team meetings, evaluation meetings | Jan 2023 - present |

| **CRM Forecast Audit Trail** *(Added Feb 21)* | **Complete audit trail for all forecasts associated with the employee: creation, modification, status changes, user IDs, notes content before/after. Includes the 9/5/2025 action specifically.** | **Jul 2025 - present (minimum); Jan 2023 - present (recommended)** |
| **HR Exit Interview Records** *(Added Feb 21)* | **Sabrina Sparapani's exit interview notes, interviewer identity, typed summaries, electronic records** | **Jul 2025** |
| **Santore Communications** *(Added Feb 21)* | **All communications between Santore and the manager, and between Santore and HR, regarding the employee, leave policies, evaluations, and Sabrina** | **Jan 2023 - present** |
| **Bloomberg MSG System** *(Added Feb 24)* | **All MSG threads to/from the manager, the employee, and all team members. Includes message content, timestamps, read receipts, attachments (GRABs), and metadata.** | **Jan 2023 - present** |

### 3.4 What Must NOT Be Done

1. **Do not delete any document, email, or record related to the employee, his team, or any subject covered above.** This includes routine auto-deletions. IT must be notified to suspend any scheduled purges for the identified custodians and systems.
2. **Do not modify, backdate, or alter any evaluation, compensation record, coverage assignment, or HR document.** If any document is found to have been altered after this date, the inference of spoliation will be devastating.
3. **Do not selectively preserve.** All responsive documents must be held, including those unfavorable to the company. Selective preservation creates a spoliation inference that is worse than the content of the unfavorable documents.
4. **Do not communicate with the employee about the litigation hold.** The hold is an internal company process. The employee should not be informed that litigation is anticipated (he already knows, but the company should not confirm it).
5. **Do not destroy or modify Sam Page's employment records under any circumstances.** If these records have already been destroyed pursuant to a routine retention schedule, document exactly when and why. The timing of any destruction relative to the employee's leaves will be scrutinized.
6. **Do not contact Sam Page, Sabrina, or any former employee identified in this document for the purpose of discussing their potential testimony.** Any such contact will be characterized as witness tampering or intimidation.

### 3.5 Physical Evidence

The employee's team has referenced the following physical/digital items that Bloomberg should identify in its own systems:

- The coverage universe document (photographed Feb 20, 2026) -- Bloomberg's internal document showing firm counts by team member.
- The job posting for the employee's team role during leave (Jul 2025) -- should be in the recruiting system.
- The manager's email denying WFH for the employee's sick child (Jun 2025) -- should be in the email system.
- The mandatory review calendar invite for Aug 8, 2025 -- should be in the calendar system.

## Section 4: Witness Preparation

### 4.1 The Manager (Highest Risk Witness)

**What he likely knows:** Everything about the employee's evaluations, coverage assignments, compensation recommendations, and daily performance. He made or recommended every adverse decision at issue. He made the attributed verbal statements.

**What he might say under oath:** The manager will likely defend his evaluations as honest assessments based on objective data. He will likely say coverage changes reflected business needs, not retaliation. He will likely deny or soften the attributed verbal statements ("joke about firing," "thought you were quitting," "we didn't cut your pay"). He may acknowledge that he knew the employee was on leave and factored in the timing, but will frame it as contextual, not retaliatory.

**Key questions he will face:**
- Every question in Section 5 below.
- Questions about Sam Page (did the same thing happen?).
- Questions about every attributed verbal statement.
- Questions about the specific rationale for every coverage decision.
- Questions about whether he reviewed Bloomberg's leave policies before writing the evaluation.
- *(Added Feb 24)* "On February 24, 2026, you sent Mr. Akulov a message asking whether he had self-assigned the Clear Street account. You had personally assigned that account to him during a one-on-one meeting the previous week. Why did you ask?"
- *(Added Feb 24)* "In your response, you wrote 'I thought I had reassigned to Tommy.' Who is Tommy? Why were you planning to take this account away from Mr. Akulov one week after assigning it to him?"
- *(Added Feb 24)* "When the Clear Street client generated 403 million notional in trading volume that same day, you wrote that the client 'prob doesnt know about switch.' Why did you frame this client's success as a gap in Mr. Akulov's work?"
- *(Added Feb 24)* "During Mr. Akulov's second parental leave, you scheduled his mid-year review. He offered to dial in. You required in-person attendance. The meeting never took place. You posted the review without conducting it. Can you explain why?"
- *(Added Feb 24)* "Is it your practice to post performance reviews without meeting with the employee? Did you do this with any other employee on your team?"

**Risks he creates:**
- If he denies making statements that are corroborated by contemporaneous messages from multiple sources, his credibility is destroyed.
- If he acknowledges the statements but tries to minimize them, the statements themselves do the damage.
- If he cannot articulate a clear, non-leave-related rationale for each coverage decision, the jury will infer leave was the reason.
- He wrote the evaluations. Every internal contradiction in those documents will be explored exhaustively.
- His demeanor under questioning about parental leave will be observed by a jury. If he displays dismissiveness, contempt, or impatience with the concept of extended paternal leave, the jury will see the animus the employee is alleging.
- *(Added Feb 24)* The Clear Street MSG exchange creates a new category of deposition risk: the manager's own written words, timestamped in Bloomberg's enterprise system, showing him questioning an assignment he made, revealing intent to strip it, and framing a client success as a deficiency. He cannot claim these messages don't exist or were taken out of context -- they are complete, timestamped, and in sequence.
- *(Added Feb 24)* The "I thought I had reassigned to Tommy" statement will require explanation. If Tommy was never assigned, Platt fabricated the claim. If Tommy was assigned, Platt was actively stripping coverage. Neither answer is good.
- *(Added Feb 24)* The mid-year review questions are a closed loop he cannot escape. If he says in-person was required by policy, the plaintiff asks for the policy. If he says it was his judgment, the plaintiff asks why he didn't accept the remote alternative. If he says the review was deferred to protect the employee's leave, the plaintiff asks why he posted it without the meeting.

**Preparation needs:**
- Must work with defense counsel to review every attributed statement and prepare a consistent account of each conversation.
- Must be coached on demeanor -- any hint of hostility toward parental leave or dismissiveness toward the employee's rights will be devastating.
- Must be prepared to explain the coverage decisions with specific business rationales, not generalized "business judgment" responses.
- Must understand that "I don't recall" is acceptable for genuinely forgotten details but will be disbelieved if used for conversations that occurred within the past two months.
- Must be told explicitly not to volunteer information, not to argue with plaintiff's counsel, and not to make jokes.

### 4.2 The Manager's Manager

**What he likely knows:** Present at the Feb 17, 2026 evaluation meeting. Likely reviewed and approved the evaluation and compensation decisions. May have visibility into coverage assignments at a high level. May have been consulted on the PIP discussion.

**What he might say under oath:** Will likely support the evaluation as a fair assessment. May say he reviewed the evaluation but defer to the manager on specific performance details. May say the compensation decision reflected company-wide austerity.

**Key questions he will face:**
- "You were present at the February 17, 2026 meeting. Did you review the evaluation before it was delivered?"
- "Did you notice that the evaluation referenced Mr. Akulov's parental leave?"
- "Did you raise any concerns about evaluating an employee's half-year performance against full-year peers?"
- "Were you aware that Mr. Akulov had the smallest coverage universe on the team?"
- "Were you aware that his revenue target was increased by 52% for 2026?"
- "Did [the manager] ever express to you any frustration or concern about Mr. Akulov's parental leave?"

**Risks he creates:**
- If he reviewed and approved the evaluation, he shares liability for its content -- including the leave references and half-year-vs-full-year comparison.
- If he did not review it, Bloomberg has a supervisory negligence problem.
- If the manager ever expressed leave-related frustration to him and he failed to act, the "knew or should have known" supervisor liability under NYCHRL attaches.

**Preparation needs:**
- Must be clear on what he reviewed, when, and whether he raised any concerns.
- Must be prepared for "did [the manager] ever say anything to you about Akulov's leave" questions.
- Must be told that blanket denials will be tested against document production (emails between the manager and his manager).

### 4.3 HR Personnel

**What they likely know:** Leave administration, evaluation review process, compensation approval process, any complaints or concerns raised about the manager. Whether Bloomberg has guidance for evaluating employees who take extended leave.

**What they might say under oath:** Will describe Bloomberg's process as thorough and fair. Will say evaluations go through review. May or may not have specific knowledge of this employee's situation.

**Key questions they will face:**
- "Does Bloomberg have a policy for how to evaluate employees who were on leave for a portion of the evaluation period?"
- "Did anyone raise a concern about comparing Mr. Akulov's half-year metrics to full-year peers?"
- "Were you aware that Mr. Akulov had the smallest coverage universe on the team?"
- "Has any Bloomberg employee ever raised a complaint about [the manager's] treatment of employees who take extended parental leave?"
- "Did you review the 2025 year-end evaluation before it was delivered? Did you notice it referenced parental leave in the first sentence?"

**Risks they create:**
- If Bloomberg has no policy for evaluating leave-takers, this is a systemic gap that makes the manager's approach appear unsupervised and unreviewed.
- If Bloomberg does have such a policy and the manager deviated from it, this proves both the violation and the company's awareness that the manager was noncompliant.
- If HR reviewed the evaluation and approved it without flagging the leave references, HR shares in the liability.
- If there were prior complaints about this manager (from Sabrina, Sam Page, or others), and HR failed to act, negligent supervision is established.

**Preparation needs:**
- HR must compile a complete record of any complaints or concerns about the manager before the deposition.
- HR should identify whether a leave-evaluation policy exists or should be created.

### 4.4 James Johnston (Comparator, Company Witness -- Likely Hostile to Plaintiff)

**What he likely knows:** His own coverage, his own evaluation history, his own leave decisions. Whether the manager has made comments about leave duration. The team dynamics regarding leave.

**What he might say under oath:** If deposed by plaintiff's counsel, Johnston will be asked pointed questions about why he chose one month of leave instead of six, whether he felt pressure not to take full leave, and what the manager's attitude toward leave was. He may be sympathetic to the company or may have his own misgivings about the manager.

**Key questions he will face:**
- "You took one month of parental leave twice. Bloomberg offers six months. Why did you choose one month?"
- "Did anyone -- your manager, HR, a colleague -- suggest that taking six months would have negative consequences?"
- "Did [the manager] ever express an opinion about employees who take the full six months of parental leave?"
- "Are you aware that your coverage universe is 6,099 firms while Mr. Akulov's is 1,138? Can you explain why?"
- "Has [the manager] ever told you or suggested that you were rewarded with more coverage because you took shorter leave?"

**Risks he creates:**
- If Johnston testifies that he felt informal pressure to take short leave, or that the manager expressed negative views about long-leave employees, this corroborates the pattern.
- If Johnston cannot explain the 5.4x coverage disparity in non-leave terms, his testimony helps the plaintiff.
- If Johnston says he chose one month freely and for personal reasons, this is neutral to the defense (it doesn't explain the coverage gap).

**Preparation needs:**
- Johnston should be prepared by defense counsel before any deposition. He should be reminded that he is answering truthfully and should not speculate.
- Defense counsel should assess Johnston's attitude toward the manager privately to anticipate whether he will be a reliable company witness or a potential risk.

### 4.5 Sam Page (Former Employee -- Plaintiff's Witness if Cooperative)

**What he likely knows:** His own experience under the manager -- leave, evaluations, coverage changes, PIP, separation. Whether the manager made negative comments about his leave. The circumstances of his departure.

**What he might say under oath:** If cooperative with the plaintiff, Page will testify to an identical pattern: leave, negative evaluation, coverage stripped, PIP, managed out. He will describe the manager as hostile to leave-takers. If he signed a broad release, he may be reluctant to testify but can likely be compelled.

**Key questions he will face (from plaintiff's counsel, if he cooperates):**
- "Did you take parental leave while under [the manager's] supervision?"
- "What happened to your coverage territories after you returned from leave?"
- "Were you placed on a PIP? What was the stated basis?"
- "Did [the manager] ever make comments about your parental leave?"
- "Do you believe you were treated differently because of your leave?"

**Risks he creates:**
- If Page corroborates the pattern, the case becomes exponentially more dangerous. Pattern-and-practice evidence from a second employee under the same manager is transformative.
- If Page signed a separation agreement with a release, the defense may argue the release precludes his participation. However, courts generally permit witnesses to testify truthfully regardless of a release, and preventing his testimony could be characterized as witness suppression.

**Preparation needs:**
- Bloomberg must locate and review Page's employment file immediately.
- If Page's PIP and separation were genuinely well-documented and based on pre-leave performance issues, prepare to present this in rebuttal.
- Defense counsel should consider whether to contact Page through counsel before the plaintiff does. This is a strategic decision with risks: contacting him could be seen as intimidation, but not contacting him cedes the narrative entirely.

### 4.6 Sabrina Sparapani (Former Employee -- Likely Hostile to Company) *(Substantially Updated Feb 21)*

**Status change from prior version:** Sabrina's role in this case has expanded significantly. She is no longer just the source of the "carried the baby" comment. New iMessage evidence shows she has first-person accounts of the manager's conduct, claims to be a pattern victim herself, and says she complained to HR in her exit interview. However, her formal willingness to cooperate with a plaintiff's attorney is unconfirmed.

**What she likely knows (expanded):**
- The "carried the baby" comment -- she claims to have heard it directly from the manager.
- Territory distribution: she told the plaintiff the manager gave him her "shitty accounts" and that coverage was inequitable.
- Her own experience under the manager, which she characterizes as the "same playbook" as what the plaintiff is experiencing.
- That Santore "approves those reviews" and, in her view, did not protect her.
- What she told HR in her exit interview -- she claims she was candid about the manager's conduct.
- She is now at BlackRock. Her current employer status is relevant to her willingness to testify (she is no longer at Bloomberg and has no retaliation risk from Bloomberg).

**What she might say under oath:** She will testify to the "carried the baby" comment as a direct first-person account. She will describe her own experience under the manager as a pattern of leave-related retaliation. She will say she warned the plaintiff to document everything. She will say she complained to HR in her exit interview. She will say Santore approves the manager's reviews and did not intervene on her behalf. She may describe specific coverage and territory decisions she experienced as retaliatory.

**Key questions she will face (from plaintiff's counsel):**
- "Did [the manager] say to you that Mr. Akulov should not be taking primary leave because he did not carry the baby?"
- "When and where did this conversation take place? Who else was present?"
- "Did [the manager] assign Mr. Akulov accounts that you considered underperforming? What did he say about it?"
- "In your experience under [the manager], did you observe a pattern of how he treated employees who took extended parental leave?"
- "You resigned in July 2025. Did you have an exit interview with HR? What did you tell them?"
- "Did you specifically mention [the manager's] treatment of employees who took parental leave during that exit interview?"
- "Were you ever told by [the manager] or anyone else that your own coverage or treatment was related to leave?"
- "You wrote to Mr. Akulov in July 2025: 'he retaliates against people who go on leave especially men.' What is the factual basis for that statement?"

**Key questions she will face (from defense counsel on cross-examination):**
- "You were in the process of resigning when you sent these messages. Correct?"
- "Were you frustrated with [the manager] at the time you sent these messages?"
- "You have your own grievances with [the manager], separate from Mr. Akulov's situation. Correct?"
- "When you say 'same playbook,' are you describing specific documented actions or your general feeling about the manager?"
- "You said [the manager] gave Mr. Akulov your 'shitty accounts.' Were those accounts underperforming at the time of assignment? Were you consulted on the rationale?"
- "You said Santore 'approves those reviews.' Were you present when Santore reviewed Mr. Akulov's evaluation? Or is this your inference?"
- "You communicated with Mr. Akulov by iMessage. Were you aware he was building a legal case? Did he ask you for information that would help his case?"

**Risks she creates (updated):**
- If she testifies credibly about the "carried the baby" comment as a first-person account, this is a gender discrimination finding almost by itself under NYCHRL. This is no longer hearsay if she testifies -- it is direct testimony from a percipient witness.
- Her pattern-victim testimony, if believed, transforms this from a single-employee dispute into evidence of systemic conduct under one manager. Two employees (Sasha, Sabrina) -- potentially three with Sam Page -- alleging the same conduct under the same supervisor is qualitatively different from one.
- If her HR exit interview notes contain specific complaints about the manager's treatment of leave-takers, Bloomberg's "we didn't know" defense is damaged. The company would have had institutional notice.
- Her iMessage statements ("he retaliates against people who go on leave especially men") are powerful characterizations that, while not independently verified, will be quoted in briefs and potentially read to a jury.

**What limits her impact:**
- Her formal cooperation is unconfirmed. Chatting with a former colleague over iMessage is not the same as agreeing to sit for a deposition, cooperate with a plaintiff's attorney, and face cross-examination.
- She is a biased witness. She left the company in circumstances she describes as adversarial. Her characterizations of the manager are colored by her own experience and grievances.
- Many of her statements are conclusory ("same playbook," "retaliates," "shitty accounts") rather than specific factual descriptions. Under cross-examination, the defense can probe whether each conclusion is supported by documented facts or by her interpretations.
- She told the plaintiff what to do ("document everything") and may have been actively helping him build a case. This creates a narrative that the two coordinated rather than independently observed the same conduct.
- The actual content of her HR exit interview is unknown. She says she was honest, but "honest" may mean she complained about general management style, not specifically about leave retaliation.

**Preparation needs (updated):**
- **URGENT: Pull Sabrina's HR exit interview notes.** What she actually told HR -- not what she told the plaintiff she told HR -- is the critical question. If the notes are specific about leave retaliation, Bloomberg had institutional notice. If they are generic, the institutional knowledge argument is weaker.
- Review Sabrina's full employment file, evaluations, coverage assignments, and departure documentation. Understand what her actual treatment was (not just her characterization of it). If her file shows legitimate performance management, her "same playbook" characterization can be challenged.
- Prepare defense counsel to cross-examine Sabrina on her bias, her conclusions vs. her facts, and her coordination with the plaintiff.
- Assess whether Sabrina signed any separation agreement or release. If so, review its terms.
- **Do NOT contact Sabrina.** Any outreach will be characterized as witness intimidation.

### 4.7 Rich Santore (Manager's Manager -- Potential Co-Defendant) *(Added Feb 21)*

**What he likely knows:** Present at the February 17, 2026 evaluation meeting. Per Sabrina, he approves the manager's reviews. May have visibility into coverage assignments and compensation decisions at a team level. May know about Sabrina's exit circumstances.

**What he might say under oath:** Will likely support the evaluation as a fair assessment and characterize his presence as standard oversight. May defer to the manager on specific performance details. May say the compensation decision reflected company-wide conditions.

**Key questions he will face:**
- "You were present at the February 17, 2026 evaluation meeting. Did you review the evaluation before it was delivered?"
- "Did you notice that the evaluation referenced Mr. Akulov's parental leave in its opening paragraph?"
- "Did you raise any concerns about evaluating an employee's half-year performance against full-year peers?"
- "Did you approve this evaluation before it was delivered?"
- "Were you aware of Sabrina Sparapani's complaints about [the manager] -- either through her exit interview or through any other channel?"
- "Did [the manager] ever express to you any frustration or concern about Mr. Akulov's parental leave?"
- "Did [the manager] ever express to you any frustration or concern about any employee's parental leave?"

**Risks he creates:**
- If he reviewed and approved the evaluation, he shares liability under NYCHRL for its content -- including leave references and half-year-vs-full-year comparison.
- If he did not review it, Bloomberg has a supervisory negligence problem.
- If the manager ever expressed leave-related frustration to Santore and Santore failed to act, supervisor liability attaches.
- If Sabrina's HR exit interview complaints reached Santore (or should have), his inaction creates institutional ratification of the alleged conduct.

**Preparation needs:**
- Must work with defense counsel on a clear account of what he reviewed, when, and whether he raised concerns.
- Must be prepared for questions about Sabrina's exit and whether her complaints reached him.
- Bloomberg should pull all communications between Santore and the manager regarding the employee to assess exposure before deposition.

### 4.8 Anthony [Last Name Unknown] (Manager on Separate Team -- Potential Plaintiff's Witness) *(Added Feb 21 evening)*

**What he likely knows:** Anthony is a manager on a separate team who asked Sasha unprompted "Does your wife work?" between his return from leave (Dec 28, 2025) and the Feb 17 evaluation. The employee's theory is that Anthony saw Sasha ranked low in the collective stack ranking sessions and was asking out of concern about the financial impact of a potential termination.

**What he might say under oath:** Unknown. If Anthony's question was casual small talk, he is a defense witness -- the question was innocent, not evidence of anything. If Anthony asked because he knew Sasha was being targeted (from stack ranking sessions or conversations with the manager), he is a devastating plaintiff's witness establishing that the retaliation was visible to others in the organization.

**Key questions he will face:**
- "Why did you ask Mr. Akulov if his wife works?"
- "Had you seen Mr. Akulov's ranking in any stack ranking or calibration session?"
- "Did [the manager] ever discuss Mr. Akulov with you?"
- "Were you concerned about Mr. Akulov's employment status at the time you asked that question?"

**Risks he creates:**
- If he testifies that he asked because he was concerned about Sasha being fired, this corroborates the employee's theory that the retaliation was visible across teams.
- If he testifies that he saw Sasha ranked low in a stack ranking session, this establishes that the manager's ranking was visible to other managers and may have been discussed.

**Preparation needs:**
- **Identify Anthony's full name immediately** before the employee's team does. The employee only knows his first name.
- Assess his likely testimony. If he would testify the question was casual, he's a defense witness. If he would testify he asked out of concern, the defense needs to know this now.
- Note: Anthony is on a different team. His testimony about his own manager or his own observations of the manager's conduct is limited. The value is in what he knew about the stack ranking.

### 4.9 Bryan Baptist (Former Employee -- Potential Plaintiff's Witness) *(Added Feb 23)*

**What he likely knows:** Baptist was on the same team. He experienced the "Rahul" misnaming firsthand and was visibly annoyed by it. His coverage (Florida) was redistributed when he left -- to everyone on the team except the employee. He would have witnessed team dynamics, coverage assignments, and the manager's behavior toward team members.

**What he might say under oath:** If cooperative with the plaintiff, Baptist will testify that the manager repeatedly called him "Rahul" despite his actual name being Bryan, that this was ethnic (he is Indian), and that it was recurring. He may also testify about coverage distribution and the manager's general management style. He may corroborate the "Comrade" usage if he witnessed it. He may testify that his Florida coverage was redistributed to peers but not to the employee, which he may characterize as selective exclusion.

**Key questions he will face (from plaintiff's counsel):**
- "Did [the manager] call you 'Rahul'? How frequently? Over what period?"
- "Is Rahul your name? Is it a name associated with Indian ethnicity?"
- "How did you feel about being called 'Rahul'?"
- "Did you ever ask [the manager] to stop? If not, why not?"
- "Did you hear [the manager] call Aleksandr Akulov 'Comrade'? How frequently?"
- "When you left Bloomberg, was your Florida coverage redistributed? To whom? Was Mr. Akulov included in that redistribution?"
- "Did you observe how [the manager] treated employees who took parental leave?"

**Key questions he will face (from defense counsel on cross-examination):**
- "Did you ever file a complaint about being called 'Rahul'?"
- "Is it possible the manager simply confused your name with someone else's?"
- "Did you leave Bloomberg voluntarily? Were you satisfied with your experience?"
- "Have you been contacted by Mr. Akulov or his attorneys about this case?"

**Risks he creates:**
- If he testifies credibly that the manager called him "Rahul" because he is Indian, this corroborates the cross-category national origin pattern. Two employees from two different ethnic backgrounds, same manager, same type of behavior.
- If he testifies that his coverage was redistributed to peers but not to the employee, this is an independent source for the coverage-stripping allegation who has no personal stake in the leave retaliation claims.
- He has no loyalty to Bloomberg (he left) and no fear of retaliation. He is a freely available witness.

**Preparation needs:**
- **Do NOT contact Baptist.** Any outreach will be characterized as witness intimidation or tampering.
- Review his employment file, evaluations, and departure documentation to understand his experience and assess his likely testimony.
- Prepare defense counsel for cross-examination focused on: whether "Rahul" was genuinely offensive to him vs. a minor annoyance he barely remembers, whether his departure was positive (undermining a bias narrative), and whether he has been influenced by the plaintiff.

## Section 5: Deposition Risks -- The Manager's Deposition

This is the single highest-risk event in the litigation. Plaintiff's counsel will have the full case file, the evaluations, the coverage data, and possibly testimony from Sam Page and Sabrina before deposing the manager. Every question will be designed to lock the manager into a version of events that either contradicts the documents or confirms the plaintiff's narrative.

### 5.1 Opening Establishment Questions

These questions establish the relationship, tenure, and context. They seem innocuous but lay traps.

**Q1:** "How long have you managed Mr. Akulov?"
- **Risk:** Establishes the length of the relationship and the manager's familiarity with the employee's capabilities.

**Q2:** "Before his first parental leave in November 2023, how would you characterize Mr. Akulov's performance?"
- **Risk:** The evaluation says "Alex historically has proven that he has the skill set to be successful." If the manager says he was a good performer, he has confirmed that the decline correlates with leave. If the manager says he was already declining, he contradicts his own evaluation.

**Q3:** "In the years before his first leave, did Mr. Akulov receive raises?"
- **Risk:** If yes (as the 16% raise suggests), this confirms that performance was positive pre-leave and negative post-leave. The timeline maps to leave, not to performance.

**Q4:** "You are aware that Bloomberg offers six months of paid parental leave as a benefit. Correct?"
- **Risk:** Establishes that the benefit exists and that taking it is the employee's legal right. Any subsequent testimony about the consequences of taking it becomes retaliation evidence.

### 5.2 The Firing "Joke" Questions

**Q5:** "Before Mr. Akulov went on his first parental leave in 2023, did you have a conversation with him about the duration of leave he planned to take?"
- **Risk:** If yes, the next question is what was said. If no, this contradicts the employee's account and becomes a credibility contest.

**Q6:** "During that conversation, did you say anything about what might happen if he took the full six months?"
- **Risk:** Direct question about the firing joke. The manager must either deny (risking credibility if corroborating witnesses testify) or acknowledge (confirming the intimidation allegation).

**Q7:** "Did you ever, in any context, joke about firing Mr. Akulov?"
- **Risk:** Broad question. Denial is risky because Noah can testify the employee told him contemporaneously, and Erb received a text about it. Acknowledgment opens the door to follow-up about the context and intent.

**Q8:** "After Mr. Akulov returned from his first leave, sometime in late 2024, did you again make a joke or comment about firing him?"
- **Risk:** The iMessage to Erb documents a second joke. Same risk calculus as Q7.

### 5.3 The Evaluation Questions

**Q9:** "I want to direct your attention to the 2025 mid-year evaluation. You wrote: 'Alex went on paternity leave on 7/14/25 and is expected to be out until 12/29/25 so there isn't much he can do to improve his standing this year.' Did I read that correctly?"
- **Risk:** Forces the manager to confirm his own words. The follow-up devastates.

**Q10:** "So you acknowledged, in writing, in Bloomberg's official evaluation system, that Mr. Akulov could not improve his standing because he was on parental leave. Correct?"
- **Risk:** The only honest answer is yes. This is the smoking gun being loaded.

**Q11:** "And then in the year-end evaluation, you wrote that Mr. Akulov 'significantly underperformed relative to his peers.' You rated him at the bottom. You recommended no raise, no bonus, and mentioned a PIP. Correct?"
- **Risk:** Yes. The next question fires the gun.

**Q12:** "Help me understand. You acknowledged he could not improve because of his leave, and then you penalized him for not improving. How do you reconcile those two statements?"
- **Risk:** This is the question that wins or loses the case. There is no good answer. "We evaluated the first half" concedes that the evaluation period was shortened by leave. "We compared him to peers at midyear" concedes that full-year peers were the benchmark for a half-year employee. Any answer confirms that leave was intertwined with the evaluation.

**Q13:** "You also wrote, 'Alex historically has proven that he has the skill set to be successful in the group.' What changed between his historical success and his current underperformance?"
- **Risk:** The honest answer -- "his performance declined after his leaves" -- is the plaintiff's entire case stated in the manager's own words.

**Q14:** "Were you aware that during the first half of 2025, Mr. Akulov had the highest number of client interactions on the team -- 648?"
- **Risk:** If yes: "Why did you characterize him as underperforming if he led the team in activity?" If no: "You wrote this evaluation without knowing the team's comparative activity data?"

**Q15:** "Were you aware that Mr. Akulov's revenue of $80,100 represented 139% of his prorated half-year target?"
- **Risk:** Same dynamic. Either the manager ignored favorable data or did not know it.

### 5.4 The Coverage Questions

**Q16:** "You assign coverage territories to team members. Correct? It's your decision who covers which firms?"
- **Risk:** Establishes the manager's control over the input variable he then used to evaluate output.

**Q17:** "When Mr. Akulov went on his first leave, his coverage of Houston and upstate New York was reassigned. Correct?"
- **Risk:** Establishes the stripping.

**Q18:** "When he returned from his first leave, that coverage was not given back to him. Correct?"
- **Risk:** Establishes non-restoration.

**Q19:** "Can you explain the business reason for not restoring Mr. Akulov's Houston and upstate New York coverage when he returned from leave?"
- **Risk:** If there is no documented business reason, the answer will be vague ("business judgment," "client continuity") and the jury will infer the real reason was leave. If there is a specific reason, it must be consistent with coverage decisions for other employees.

**Q20:** "When Bryan Baptist left the company, you redistributed his Florida coverage to other team members. You did not give any of that coverage to Mr. Akulov. Why?"
- **Risk:** Same dynamic. Specific business rationale required. The employee had offered to help from leave, and the manager declined.

**Q21:** "As of today, Mr. Akulov has 1,138 firms in his coverage universe. James Johnston has 6,099. Can you explain why one member of your team has 5.4 times the coverage of another?"
- **Risk:** This is the question the defense must have a compelling answer for. If the answer takes more than 30 seconds to articulate, the jury will not buy it.

**Q22:** "Is it true that you increased Mr. Akulov's revenue target from $115,000 to $175,000 for 2026 -- a 52% increase -- while he had the fewest clients of anyone on the team?"
- **Risk:** The math speaks for itself. The manager must explain why the target went up while the means went down.

### 5.5 The Attributed Statement Questions

**Q23:** "During the February 17, 2026 evaluation meeting or the follow-up conversation that day, did you tell Mr. Akulov that you had ranked him low because you thought he was going to quit and get another job during his paternity leave?"
- **Risk:** Denial is risky because it was reported same-day to multiple friends. Admission is catastrophic.

**Q24:** "Did you tell Mr. Akulov, 'We like you a lot, we don't cut your pay and you were away for six months'?"
- **Risk:** Same calculus. The defense will argue this was intended as supportive, but the words link compensation to leave.

**Q25:** "In February 2025, when Mr. Akulov received a 0% raise, did you tell him, off the record or otherwise, that the reason was related to his having taken six months of parental leave?"
- **Risk:** Denial becomes a credibility contest. The employee reported this same-day in WhatsApp.

**Q26:** "Did you ever tell Mr. Akulov or anyone else that he shouldn't be taking primary leave for six months because, quote, it's not like he carried the baby?"
- **Risk:** If Sabrina testifies before this deposition, the manager is boxed in. Denial when an eyewitness has already testified destroys credibility.

**Q27:** "Did you ever say that Corey Levine would not become a manager because he took six months of parental leave?"
- **Risk:** Same dynamic. If Levine corroborates, denial is devastating.

### 5.6 The Sam Page Questions

**Q28:** "Sam Page was a member of your team who took parental leave. Correct?"
- **Risk:** If yes, every follow-up about Page's trajectory mirrors the employee's.

**Q29:** "After Sam Page returned from parental leave, did you make any changes to his coverage territories?"
- **Risk:** If the answer is yes, the pattern is confirmed from the manager's own mouth.

**Q30:** "Was Sam Page placed on a performance improvement plan?"
- **Risk:** If yes: "When, relative to his return from leave?" If no: "So Mr. Akulov is the only leave-taker you've threatened with a PIP?"

**Q31:** "Did Sam Page leave Bloomberg? Was it voluntary or involuntary?"
- **Risk:** Either answer feeds the narrative. Involuntary confirms termination. "Voluntary" will be tested against the separation documentation.

**Q32:** "Can you identify any employee under your management who took the full six months of parental leave and who did not subsequently receive a negative evaluation, reduced coverage, or adverse compensation?"
- **Risk:** This is the kill shot. If the manager cannot name one, the pattern is proven. If he can, the defense has a counter-example. The answer must be prepared in advance.

### 5.7 The Sabrina Questions *(Added Feb 21)*

**Q33:** "Are you aware of a former team member named Sabrina Sparapani?"
- **Risk:** Establishes the relationship. Follow-up questions will use her iMessage statements.

**Q34:** "Did you ever tell Sabrina Sparapani that Mr. Akulov 'shouldn't be taking primary leave for six months because it's not like he carried the baby'?"
- **Risk:** If Sabrina has already testified to this as a first-person account, denial destroys the manager's credibility. If he acknowledges it, this is a textbook gender stereotyping admission. If he says "I don't recall," it sounds evasive when a specific statement is at issue.

**Q35:** "Did you ever tell Sabrina Sparapani or any other team member that you assigned Mr. Akulov underperforming accounts? Accounts Sabrina described as her 'shitty accounts'?"
- **Risk:** Confirms the account-quality allegation from the manager's own mouth, or creates a credibility contest with Sabrina.

**Q36:** "Sabrina Sparapani resigned in July 2025. Were you aware that she raised complaints about you in her HR exit interview?"
- **Risk:** If yes: "What did you do about it?" If no: "You were unaware that a departing team member complained about your management of employees who took leave?" Either answer is damaging.

**Q37:** "Did Rich Santore ever discuss Sabrina Sparapani's exit interview with you?"
- **Risk:** Probes whether the chain of command was informed and failed to act.

### 5.8 The Forecast Tampering Questions *(Added Feb 21)*

**Q38:** "On or about September 5, 2025, did you close a CRM forecast associated with Mr. Akulov as a 'duplicate'?"
- **Risk:** The CRM audit trail will either confirm or deny this. If it confirms, the next questions are devastating. If it denies, this set of questions is defused.

**Q39:** "When you closed that forecast, did you remove or modify any notes associated with it?"
- **Risk:** "Notes stripped" is the employee's characterization. The audit trail will show what actually happened. If notes were removed, the question is why.

**Q40:** "Did you reopen a similar forecast the same day? Under whose name?"
- **Risk:** Same-day close-and-reopen is the core of the allegation. The audit trail is the source of truth.

**Q41:** "The year-end evaluation stated 'we were able to book' a deal while Mr. Akulov was on leave. Who is 'we'?"
- **Risk:** If "we" means the manager and team (excluding the employee), the language corroborates the allegation that credit was redirected. If "we" includes the employee, the language is standard team-speak.

**Q42:** "Are you aware that Mr. Akulov claims this CRM action was intended to suppress his revenue numbers before his evaluation? What is your response?"
- **Risk:** Forces the manager to provide his version of events. Whatever he says is locked in under oath and will be tested against the audit trail.

**Q43:** "You hold a Series 24 license. Are you aware of FINRA's requirements regarding the integrity of client records and sales attribution?"
- **Risk:** Establishes the regulatory dimension. If the audit trail is problematic, this question foreshadows a FINRA referral.

### 5.10 The National Origin Questions *(Added Feb 23)*

**Q44:** "Did you regularly call Mr. Akulov 'Comrade'?"
- **Risk:** If he denies, three team witnesses (Emily, JJ, Sabrina) can contradict him, destroying his credibility. If he admits, every follow-up question is devastating.

**Q45:** "Mr. Akulov is Russian. You are aware of that. When you called him 'Comrade,' were you aware that 'Comrade' is a term historically associated with Soviet Russia?"
- **Risk:** Denial of awareness is implausible -- "Comrade" is universally recognized as a Soviet/Communist reference. Acknowledgment confirms the ethnic dimension.

**Q46:** "How often did you call Mr. Akulov 'Comrade' compared to using his actual name?"
- **Risk:** The employee says more often than his actual name. If witnesses corroborate, the manager cannot minimize the frequency.

**Q47:** "Who was present when you called Mr. Akulov 'Comrade'?"
- **Risk:** Team members were present. This was not private -- it was public, recurring ethnic labeling in front of the team.

**Q48:** "You stopped calling Mr. Akulov 'Comrade' at some point. When did you stop? Why?"
- **Risk:** This is potentially the most devastating question in the national origin sequence. Any answer confirming he stopped acknowledges the behavior existed. The "why" forces him to either (a) admit he recognized it was wrong, (b) claim Sasha asked him to stop (which Sasha denies), or (c) say he just naturally stopped (which the jury will not believe given the timing).

**Q49:** "Did you call Bryan Baptist 'Rahul'?"
- **Risk:** If Baptist has already testified, denial is suicidal. If he admits, the cross-category pattern is established from his own mouth.

**Q50:** "Is 'Rahul' a common Indian name? Is Bryan Baptist Indian?"
- **Risk:** Establishes that the manager knew the ethnic association and applied it anyway.

**Q51:** "So you called your Russian employee 'Comrade' and your Indian employee 'Rahul.' Did you give any of your non-minority team members ethnically-coded nicknames?"
- **Risk:** This is the kill shot for the national origin claim. If the answer is no -- only the Russian and Indian employees received ethnic labels -- the pattern is proven. If the answer is "I gave everyone nicknames," the follow-up is "what was James Johnston's nickname?" and the manager will struggle to produce one.

### 5.11 The Clear Street Account Questions *(Added Feb 24)*

**Q52:** "You assigned Mr. Akulov to the Clear Street account during a one-on-one meeting. One week later, you asked him in writing whether he had self-assigned it. Do you remember assigning it?"
- **Risk:** The manager's own MSG, timestamped in Bloomberg's enterprise system, shows him questioning an assignment he personally made. Either he forgot (undermining his competence on coverage decisions) or he was laying groundwork to strip the account. Neither answer is good.

**Q53:** "You wrote 'I thought I had reassigned to Tommy.' When did you decide to reassign it? Before or after Mr. Akulov began generating revenue from the account?"
- **Risk:** This question forces a timeline. If the reassignment decision came after revenue materialized, the pattern is: assign, watch the employee generate value, strip it. If the decision predated the revenue, the manager was planning to strip coverage from a recently-returned leave-taker within a week of assigning it.

**Q54:** "The client generated 403 million in notional trading volume on February 24. Instead of acknowledging that, you wrote that the client 'prob doesnt know about switch.' Is that how you typically respond when a team member's client generates significant volume?"
- **Risk:** Reframing a client success as a gap is the core of the "setup to fail" narrative. The jury hears: the employee's client generated hundreds of millions in volume, and the manager's response was to note the client hadn't been told about the reassignment yet.

### 5.12 The Mid-Year Review Questions *(Added Feb 24)*

**Q55:** "You scheduled Mr. Akulov's mid-year review during his paternity leave. He offered to participate by phone. You told him it had to be in person. Then you posted the review without having the meeting. Is that correct?"
- **Risk:** This is a three-part factual predicate that the manager must either confirm or deny. If confirmed, the follow-up questions are devastating. If denied, the employee has contemporaneous documentation.

**Q56:** "Ms. Sparapani testified that the same thing happened to her -- her mid-year review was posted without a meeting. Is it your practice to post reviews without conducting the review meeting?"
- **Risk:** If Sabrina has testified, this establishes a pattern of denying leave-takers the feedback meeting while still posting adverse evaluations. If the manager says it is his practice generally, the follow-up asks why non-leave employees received meetings. If he says it is not his practice, the plaintiff asks why two leave-takers were treated differently.

**Q57:** "Your year-end evaluation stated that Mr. Akulov couldn't improve his standing because he was on leave. But you also denied him the mid-year feedback session that would have told him what to improve. How was he supposed to improve?"
- **Risk:** This closes the logical loop. The manager acknowledged the employee couldn't improve because of leave. He also denied the employee the feedback mechanism that might have enabled improvement. This is a self-sealing system: deny feedback, then penalize for failure to improve.

### 5.13 Demeanor Risks

Beyond the content of answers, the manager's demeanor under questioning about parental leave will be closely observed. If the manager:

- Displays impatience or dismissiveness when discussing the employee's leave decisions, the jury will see the animus.
- Becomes defensive or combative when confronted with contradictions in the evaluation, the jury will infer consciousness of guilt.
- Uses language that minimizes the importance of parental leave ("he was gone for six months" said with irritation), the jury will hear the manager's true feelings.
- Is unable to articulate clear business rationales and instead falls back on "judgment calls" or "I'm the manager," the jury will infer that the real reasons are not ones the manager wants to say out loud.

**Critical preparation note:** The manager must be coached extensively on demeanor. Employment litigation is won and lost on credibility. A sympathetic, thoughtful, articulate manager who acknowledges imperfect communication but convincingly explains performance-based rationales can survive this deposition. A dismissive, evasive, or hostile manager will lose this case in the deposition room regardless of what the documents say.

## Section 6: Key Arguments for Defense on Each Theory

### 6.1 FMLA Retaliation Defense

**Affirmative Defense:** Legitimate, non-retaliatory basis for all adverse actions. The employee's midyear performance metrics (revenue, strategic adoptions, visit quality, pipeline development) were objectively below peer levels during the active working period. Coverage changes reflected routine business management during extended absence. Compensation decisions were consistent with company-wide austerity in February 2026.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, the employer need only articulate a legitimate reason -- the employee must then demonstrate pretext. Bloomberg can point to the specific deficiencies cited in the evaluation (one revenue event of $26,300 at midyear, only 3 strategic adoptions that were not sustained, insufficient CT visit breadth, shortened days) and argue that these are objective, verifiable performance metrics that have nothing to do with leave. See also EEOC v. Bloomberg L.P. (S.D.N.Y. 2007, aff'd 2d Cir. 2015) -- Bloomberg successfully defeated a pattern/practice pregnancy discrimination case, demonstrating institutional competence in articulating legitimate business reasons.

**Weakest Point:** The pretext step. The evaluation's own internal contradictions (acknowledging leave prevents improvement, then penalizing lack of improvement), the counter-metrics showing the employee led the team, and the coverage disparity all support an inference that the articulated reasons are pretextual. The "thought you were quitting" admission is particularly damaging because it reveals a leave-related motivation behind the ranking decision.

**Evidence That Would Strengthen It:** (a) Team-wide performance data showing the employee actually was at the bottom on each cited metric; (b) prior documented feedback on the same issues before any leave was taken; (c) evidence of other employees who received negative evaluations after returning from non-leave absences (showing the evaluation approach is applied broadly); (d) comparative compensation data showing widespread zero raises in Feb 2026.

---

### 6.2 FMLA Interference Defense

**Affirmative Defense:** The employee's position was fully restored upon his return from leave. He retained the same title, salary, reporting relationship, and core job function. The job posting was for additional headcount, not a replacement. The mandatory review scheduling was an administrative oversight corrected when flagged.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** FMLA restoration requires return to the "same or equivalent position." The employee returned to his position. He was not displaced by a new hire. The economic terms of employment (salary, benefits) were unchanged. Under Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc. (2d Cir. 2006), minor changes in duties or conditions do not constitute interference if the position is substantially equivalent.

**Weakest Point:** The "equivalent position" argument if pre-leave coverage was substantially larger than post-leave coverage. If the employee's coverage universe shrank from a significantly higher number to 1,138 firms because of leave-period reassignments that were never reversed, a jury could find the restored position was not equivalent in revenue-generating capacity even if the title was the same. This is especially dangerous given the concurrent target increase.

**Evidence That Would Strengthen It:** (a) Pre-leave coverage numbers for the employee (if they were already low relative to peers before the first leave, the disparity is not leave-caused); (b) the job posting requisition showing it was for a different role or additional headcount; (c) documented team staffing needs independent of the employee's leave.

---

### 6.3 NYCHRL Caregiver Status Defense

**Affirmative Defense:** All adverse actions were based on documented performance deficiencies, not caregiver status. The manager's statements are being taken out of context or are uncorroborated hearsay. Bloomberg's generous parental leave policy demonstrates institutional commitment to supporting caregivers.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** Bloomberg can argue that the NYCHRL does not immunize employees from legitimate performance management merely because they have children. Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am. (2d Cir. 2013, applying NYCHRL) establishes that while the NYCHRL is construed broadly, the plaintiff must still demonstrate that the protected characteristic was a motivating factor, and the employer can prevail if it proves the same action would have been taken regardless. If Bloomberg can show that the employee's specific performance gaps (not volume metrics, but qualitative shortfalls) would have warranted the same evaluation and compensation regardless of leave, the defense succeeds.

**Weakest Point:** The "motivating factor" standard is extremely favorable to plaintiffs. The manager's attributed statements tying decisions to leave, the temporal pattern across two cycles, and the coverage disparity correlated to leave duration all make it nearly impossible to argue that leave was not at least a motivating factor. Summary judgment is disfavored under NYCHRL. This theory will go to a jury.

**Evidence That Would Strengthen It:** (a) Other team members who are parents and who were not adversely affected (showing caregiver status alone did not drive decisions); (b) evidence that the specific qualitative deficiencies cited in the evaluation were raised with the employee before his leave was announced; (c) any favorable internal review of this employee's work that post-dates his leave and was written by a different supervisor.

---

### 6.4 NYCHRL Gender Discrimination Defense

**Affirmative Defense:** Bloomberg's parental leave policy is gender-neutral. The manager applied the same performance standards to all employees regardless of gender. The "carried the baby" comment is unverified hearsay from a potentially biased source.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** Bloomberg offers equal leave to fathers and mothers -- the policy itself negates institutional gender discrimination. An isolated remark by one manager, if it occurred, does not constitute company-wide gender discrimination. Under Forrest v. Jewish Guild for the Blind (2d Cir. 2003, applying NYCHRL), stray remarks by decision-makers, while relevant, are not dispositive absent evidence that the remark influenced the specific adverse action.

**Weakest Point:** If Sabrina testifies credibly, the remark is not "stray" -- it is a direct expression of the animus that drove the adverse actions. Under NYCHRL's motivating-factor standard, a supervisor's statement that a male employee should not take full leave "because he didn't carry the baby" is powerful evidence that gender stereotyping motivated the adverse treatment. The remark was made by the decision-maker (the manager who wrote the evaluations and controlled coverage), not a bystander.

**Evidence That Would Strengthen It:** (a) Evidence of fathers under other managers who took full leave without adverse consequences; (b) Bloomberg-wide data showing equal treatment of paternal and maternal leave-takers; (c) evidence undermining Sabrina's credibility or demonstrating a motive to fabricate.

---

### 6.5 NYCHRL Retaliation Defense (Post-Complaint)

**Affirmative Defense:** Any adverse actions following a complaint were already in progress before the complaint was filed and were based on documented performance concerns.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** If the PIP was discussed in the February 2026 evaluation and the employee files a complaint in March 2026, the PIP decision pre-dates the protected activity. Clark County School District v. Breeden (2001) establishes that an employer is not liable for retaliation when the adverse action was initiated before the protected activity.

**Weakest Point:** The actual implementation of a PIP after a complaint, even if discussed before, will create a temporal inference. And if any escalation occurs (termination, further coverage reduction) after a complaint, it will be nearly impossible to separate from the complaint timing.

---

### 6.6 NY PFL Retaliation Defense

**Affirmative Defense:** Same as FMLA retaliation -- legitimate performance basis for all actions.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** Same framework. NY PFL retaliation cases are relatively new (PFL effective 2018) with limited case law, which may give the defense more room to argue about the scope of "adverse action" and causation requirements.

**Weakest Point:** The Workers' Compensation Board can investigate independently, creating an additional proceeding that the company must respond to regardless of the civil case outcome.

---

### 6.7 Title VII Defense

**Affirmative Defense:** Same as NYCHRL gender discrimination -- gender-neutral policy, legitimate performance basis, isolated remark.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** Title VII requires filing an EEOC charge within 300 days. Some earlier adverse actions (first leave cycle, 2023-2024) may be time-barred. Additionally, the "carried the baby" comment, if treated as the anchor of the gender stereotyping claim, is hearsay from a third party (Sabrina), and Title VII's evidentiary standards are less liberal than NYCHRL.

**Weakest Point:** If the EEOC takes the charge seriously and investigates Bloomberg's treatment of parental leave-takers company-wide, the exposure expands dramatically.

---

### 6.8 NYSHRL Defense

**Affirmative Defense:** Same as NYCHRL theories. NYSHRL claims will rise and fall with the NYCHRL claims given the post-2019 alignment of standards.

---

### Theory 9: NYCHRL National Origin Discrimination / Hostile Work Environment (NYC Admin Code Section 8-107) *(Added Feb 23)*

**Statutory Basis:** The NYCHRL prohibits discrimination based on national origin, including the creation of a hostile work environment through unwelcome conduct based on an employee's national origin. Under NYCHRL, a plaintiff need not show that the conduct was "severe or pervasive" (the federal standard); the question is whether the employee was treated less well than others because of their national origin. Even a single incident can suffice if it is sufficient to raise an issue of fact. Recurring conduct over a year easily clears this bar.

**How the Evidence Maps:**

- **"Comrade" as recurring greeting:** The manager regularly addressed the employee (who is Russian) as "Comrade" rather than his actual name for over a year, in front of team members Emily, JJ, and Sabrina. The term is a culturally-charged reference to the employee's Russian national origin (Soviet/Communist connotation). It was used more frequently than the employee's actual name. The manager has since stopped -- the employee says "he knows I'll use it against him."
- **"Rahul" misnaming:** The same manager repeatedly called Indian team member Bryan Baptist by the stereotypically Indian name "Rahul." Baptist was visibly annoyed but did not formally object. This was recurring, not a one-time mistake.
- **Cross-category pattern:** Two employees from two different ethnic backgrounds, both subjected to ethnically-coded name substitutions by the same manager. This demonstrates a pattern of national origin-based conduct, not an isolated joke with one individual.
- **Self-correction as consciousness of guilt:** The manager stopped using "Comrade" because, per the employee, "he knows I'll use it against him." Under employment law, self-correction without prompting is often treated as evidence that the individual recognized the behavior was wrongful.
- **Witnesses:** Three team members (Emily, JJ, Sabrina) witnessed the "Comrade" usage. Bryan Baptist experienced the "Rahul" misnaming firsthand and has left Bloomberg (no retaliation risk for cooperating).

**Company's Strongest Defense:** (a) "Comrade" was an informal, affectionate greeting -- like "buddy" or "chief" -- with no discriminatory intent. The employee never objected. (b) "Rahul" was an innocent name mix-up, not an ethnic epithet. (c) Bloomberg has strong anti-harassment policies and the manager completed required training. (d) The employee is using normal workplace banter to manufacture a claim after deciding to pursue litigation.

**Key Risk:** This theory is extremely dangerous under NYCHRL:

1. **NYCHRL's low threshold.** The "treated less well" standard does not require proof that the conduct was severe or pervasive. Recurring ethnic name substitutions over a year, witnessed by the team, clear the bar easily.
2. **Cross-category corroboration.** "Comrade" for the Russian + "Rahul" for the Indian = pattern evidence nearly impossible to explain as coincidental office banter.
3. **Self-correction kills the "innocent intent" defense.** If the term was genuinely innocent, why stop? The manager's behavioral change demonstrates awareness of wrongdoing.
4. **Broadens the case narrative.** Transforms the litigation from "leave retaliation" to "discriminatory manager who targeted employees based on national origin AND family status." Multi-category pattern dramatically increases damages exposure.
5. **Bryan Baptist as independent witness.** Left Bloomberg, annoyed by misnaming, coverage redistributed to everyone except the employee. He has personal knowledge of both national origin conduct and coverage stripping.

**Statute of Limitations:** Three years under NYCHRL for filing in court. The "Comrade" usage over the past year falls well within the window. Under the continuing violation doctrine, the entire period of recurring conduct is actionable.

---

### 6.9 NYCHRL National Origin Defense *(Added Feb 23)*

**Affirmative Defense:** "Comrade" was an informal, affectionate greeting used in a casual workplace environment. No discriminatory intent. The employee never objected or complained. "Rahul" was a genuine name confusion, not an ethnic epithet. Bloomberg has strong anti-harassment policies and provides regular training to all managers.

**Strongest Precedent/Argument:** Under NYCHRL, the employer can argue that the conduct, while perhaps insensitive, did not rise to the level of treating the employee "less well" in a manner that would affect the terms and conditions of employment. Informal nicknames are common in financial services sales environments. The employee's failure to object for over a year, combined with his apparent participation in the informal workplace culture, suggests the term was not unwelcome at the time -- it only became "discrimination" after the employee decided to pursue litigation.

**Weakest Point:** Nearly every element of this defense has a devastating counter:
- "No discriminatory intent" -- then why stop? Self-correction demonstrates awareness.
- "He never objected" -- NYCHRL does not require an employee to object. And the power dynamic (manager vs. subordinate) explains why he wouldn't.
- "Name confusion" for "Rahul" -- the same manager applying ethnic labels to employees from two different backgrounds establishes a pattern, not a one-time mistake.
- "Common in the workplace" -- only if other non-minority employees also received ethnically-coded nicknames. If only the Russian and Indian employees got ethnic labels, this defense collapses.

**Evidence That Would Strengthen It:** (a) Evidence that the manager used informal nicknames or terms of address with ALL team members, not just ethnic minorities; (b) evidence that "Comrade" was used in a context where it had no ethnic connotation (e.g., team-wide inside joke unrelated to Russia); (c) evidence that Bryan Baptist used "Rahul" as a joke himself or otherwise indicated it was not offensive to him; (d) completion records for Bloomberg's anti-harassment training.

## Section 7: Settlement Considerations

### 7.1 When Settlement Becomes Cheaper Than Litigation

**Pre-filing:** If the company resolves this before a complaint is filed, the cost is limited to the settlement amount and internal counsel time. No external litigation fees, no discovery burden, no public record. This is the cheapest resolution window but requires the employee (and his attorney) to accept a pre-litigation settlement, which depends on their assessment of the case's value.

**Post-filing, pre-discovery:** After a complaint is filed but before discovery begins, the case is public but the damage is contained. Settlement avoids the discovery burden (which will be substantial given the document preservation requirements above) and avoids depositions. Typical window: mediation during the first 3-6 months after filing.

**Post-discovery, pre-trial:** After discovery, both sides know what the evidence actually shows. If discovery confirms the employee's allegations (coverage disparity documented in Bloomberg records, Sam Page file mirrors the pattern, no contemporaneous business rationale for coverage decisions), the company's settlement leverage drops dramatically. If discovery reveals weaknesses in the employee's case (pre-leave performance issues, team-wide austerity, Page's departure was well-documented), the company's leverage improves.

**During trial:** Settlement during trial is the most expensive because attorney fees are highest, the evidence has been presented to a jury, and both sides are evaluating risk in real time. However, it avoids a potentially catastrophic verdict.

**Recommendation:** The optimal settlement window is after the company has completed its internal investigation (to know its actual exposure) but before formal discovery begins (to avoid the cost and document production risk). If the internal investigation reveals that the Sam Page file is bad, the coverage decisions have no documentation, and the target increase was disproportionate, settlement before discovery is strongly advisable.

### 7.2 Likely Damages Ranges

| Theory | Statutory Damages | Likely Range (Individual) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FMLA Retaliation | Back pay + liquidated damages (2x back pay for willful violations) + attorney's fees | $200K - $600K | Back pay includes lost raises, bonuses, and potential future earnings loss if terminated. Liquidated damages double this for willful violations. |
| FMLA Interference | Same as retaliation | Typically lower, $100K - $300K | Interference claims are harder to prove and produce smaller awards than retaliation claims. |
| NYCHRL Caregiver Status | Uncapped compensatory + punitive + attorney's fees | $500K - $2M+ | NYC juries award significant damages in caregiver discrimination cases. The Phillips & Associates firm obtained a $1.8M verdict in Pardovani (SDNY) for paternity leave retaliation. Outten & Golden obtained $5M in Rotondo (class settlement). |
| NYCHRL Gender | Uncapped compensatory + punitive + attorney's fees | Overlaps with caregiver claim; unlikely to double damages but increases probability of a large verdict | Adds a sympathetic dimension that increases jury awards. |
| NY PFL | Penalties imposed by Workers' Compensation Board + reinstatement | Administrative penalties typically modest ($500 - $5,000 per violation) | The PFL complaint is more useful as leverage than as a damages vehicle. |
| Title VII | Compensatory + punitive (capped at $300K for 500+ employee employer) + attorney's fees | $100K - $300K (capped) | The cap limits exposure but the EEOC investigation risk is the real cost. |
| NYSHRL | Uncapped compensatory + punitive + attorney's fees | Overlaps with NYCHRL; allows recovery of uncapped damages at the state level | Provides an alternative forum and additional recovery mechanism. |
| NYCHRL National Origin *(Added Feb 23)* | Uncapped compensatory + punitive + attorney's fees | $200K - $800K+ | Independent claim that adds baseline settlement value. Cross-category pattern (Russian + Indian) strengthens all other claims. Adds to jury sympathy and overall damages. |

**Aggregate Individual Exposure:** Accounting for the fact that damages from overlapping theories are not fully cumulative, the realistic individual exposure range is:

- **Low end (strong defense, weaker plaintiff's counsel):** $300,000 - $500,000 (settlement value). National origin claim adds baseline value even in best case.
- **Middle (competent counsel both sides, jury trial):** $600,000 - $1,500,000. National origin claim adds settlement leverage and broadens the case. Floor raised by live contemporaneous evidence.
- **High end (Sam Page corroborates, strong plaintiff's counsel, NYC jury verdict):** $1,500,000 - $3,000,000+
- **Catastrophic (pattern finding, connection to Ndugga class action, punitive damages):** $3,000,000 - $10,000,000+

**Feb 24 impact on settlement calculus:** The Clear Street exchanges and mid-year review denial raise the settlement floor. Live, timestamped evidence in Bloomberg's own enterprise systems is qualitatively different from historical recollections and personal messages. It is harder to challenge in discovery, harder to contextualize at deposition, and more intuitive to a jury. The opponent's support team characterized this as "real-time evidence of ongoing retaliatory behavior." They are correct.

**Phillips retainer scope note:** The retainer is pre-litigation only (Section 11 -- drops at RTS). This means the initial phase will be a demand letter and/or EEOC/agency filing, not a full lawsuit. Settlement pressure during pre-litigation is lower than during active litigation, which may create a narrow window for resolution at lower cost. However, if Sasha retains a full-service litigation firm (Outten & Golden, Wigdor, Cohen Milstein), the pre-litigation limitation disappears.

### 7.3 Non-Monetary Costs of Litigation

1. **Discovery burden:** The document preservation and production requirements outlined in Sections 2 and 3 will consume significant IT, HR, and legal department resources. Based on the scope of anticipated discovery, estimated cost: $200,000 - $500,000 in e-discovery and document review alone.

2. **Management distraction:** The manager, his manager, HR personnel, and potentially senior leadership will spend substantial time on depositions, preparation, document collection, and testimony. Estimated impact: 200-400 hours of management time across all custodians.

3. **Reputational risk:** A filed lawsuit becomes a public record. Bloomberg's name will appear in headlines alongside "parental leave retaliation" and "paternity discrimination." This is especially damaging for a company that markets its parental leave policy as a recruiting advantage. The proximity to the existing Ndugga class action compounds reputational damage -- Bloomberg faces multiple simultaneous discrimination claims.

4. **Class action risk:** If Cohen Milstein / Donna Clancy becomes involved, the employee's individual case could be used to strengthen the existing Ndugga class action or to support a new class action focused specifically on parental leave retaliation. This transforms an individual case into an enterprise-level threat.

5. **Regulatory risk:** An EEOC charge or NYC Commission on Human Rights complaint could trigger a broader investigation into Bloomberg's treatment of parental leave-takers. This is beyond the individual case and could affect company-wide policies.

6. **Precedent risk:** A verdict or significant settlement for this employee creates a roadmap for every other Bloomberg employee who feels they were penalized for taking parental leave. Bloomberg's institutional interest in not creating this precedent is significant.

7. **Insurance:** Verify whether Bloomberg has Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) and whether this claim falls within coverage. EPLI may cover defense costs and settlement but often has high deductibles.

### 7.4 Settlement Terms That Might Be Acceptable

A settlement package would typically include:

- **Monetary payment:** See ranges above. The number depends on when settlement occurs, the strength of evidence, and whether Sam Page has cooperated.
- **Neutral reference:** Bloomberg agrees to provide a neutral employment reference (confirming dates of employment and title only).
- **Mutual non-disparagement:** Both parties agree not to make negative public statements.
- **Confidentiality clause:** The settlement amount is confidential. The existence of the settlement may or may not be confidential depending on negotiation.
- **Release of claims:** The employee releases all claims related to the alleged conduct.
- **No admission of liability:** Standard -- Bloomberg does not admit wrongdoing.
- **Separation terms (if applicable):** If the employee leaves Bloomberg as part of the settlement, severance payments, continuation of benefits, vesting of equity/retirement benefits.
- **Reporting to EEOC/NYCHRL (if applicable):** If a charge or complaint has been filed, the settlement may include withdrawal of the charge.

**What Bloomberg should be cautious about:**

- **Overly broad confidentiality:** If the settlement is too restrictive, it may be challenged. Courts increasingly disfavor confidentiality provisions that prevent employees from discussing workplace discrimination.
- **Retaliation for settlement:** If the employee remains employed after settlement, any subsequent adverse action will be scrutinized as retaliation for having raised the claim. The post-settlement management relationship requires extreme care.
- **Other employees' awareness:** If team members learn about the settlement, it could encourage similar claims. This argues for confidentiality but also for addressing the underlying management issues to prevent recurrence.

### 7.5 The Sam Page Variable

Sam Page is the single biggest variable in the settlement calculus.

- **If Page does not cooperate:** The case is an individual claim. The pattern allegation relies on the employee's secondhand account, which is weaker. Settlement value: lower end of the ranges above.
- **If Page cooperates and his experience mirrors the employee's account:** The case becomes a pattern case. Two employees, same manager, identical sequence. Settlement value jumps to the mid-to-high range. The risk of a large jury verdict increases substantially. The company should consider settling before Page's cooperation is formalized, if possible.
- **If Page has already settled with Bloomberg under a release that covers these facts:** Page may be reluctant to participate, but a release typically cannot prevent truthful testimony in another person's lawsuit. The release may, however, limit Page's willingness to proactively engage with the employee's attorney.

### 7.6 The Cohen Milstein Variable

If Donna Clancy or Cohen Milstein becomes involved in the employee's case, the dynamics change in several ways:

1. **Connection to Ndugga:** The employee's evidence (gender stereotyping, sex-based leave discrimination) could be used to support the existing class action's theory that Bloomberg systematically discriminates based on sex. Even if the employee does not join the class, his evidence could be referenced.

2. **Institutional knowledge:** Clancy has investigated Bloomberg for four years. She has discovery from the Ndugga case. She may already have documents (evaluations, HR policies, compensation data) that the employee's individual case would need. This dramatically shortens the employee's preparation time and increases the quality of his case.

3. **Bloomberg-specific strategy:** Clancy knows how Bloomberg defends these cases. She has seen their litigation playbook. This reduces the effectiveness of Bloomberg's standard defense strategies.

4. **Publicity:** Cohen Milstein represents the Ndugga class. If they also take this individual paternity leave case, Bloomberg faces coordinated media exposure from a major firm already engaged in adverse litigation against it.

**Impact on settlement:** Cohen Milstein / Clancy involvement increases settlement value by 30-50% over what it would be with a less Bloomberg-experienced firm, because the litigation would be more efficient, more informed, and more threatening.

### 7.7 Bloomberg's Institutional Interest

Bloomberg must weigh two competing interests:

1. **Not setting a precedent.** A large settlement or verdict for an employee who took full parental leave signals to every Bloomberg employee that the parental leave benefit comes with a hidden cost -- and that Bloomberg will pay if you call them on it. This could trigger a wave of similar claims. The company's interest in deterrence argues for fighting the case aggressively.

2. **Not fighting a losing battle publicly.** If the evidence is as strong as the employee's case file suggests, an aggressive defense that results in a large jury verdict, adverse publicity, and attorney fee shifting is worse than a managed settlement. The company's interest in risk management argues for early resolution.

**Recommendation:** The decision between these two depends on what the internal investigation reveals. If the defense has strong data (pre-leave performance issues, team-wide austerity, documented coverage rationale, Sam Page file is clean), fighting may be the right call. If the data confirms the employee's narrative, early, confidential settlement before formal discovery begins is the rational path.

## Section 8: Immediate Action Items

### Priority 0: CRM Audit Trail and HR Exit Interview Notes (Do IMMEDIATELY) *(Added Feb 21)*

**These two items are the most time-sensitive actions in the entire defense. They must be completed before any other action because the answers determine the defense posture on multiple fronts.**

0a. **Pull the complete CRM audit trail for all forecasts associated with Aleksandr Akulov for the period August 1 - October 31, 2025.** Specifically: what happened on or about September 5, 2025? Who modified which forecast, what was changed, were notes removed, was any record closed as "duplicate" and reopened? The employee alleges the manager closed a ~$58K forecast as "dupe," stripped notes, and reopened it. If the audit trail shows routine CRM maintenance, this allegation dies and damages the employee's credibility. If it confirms the employee's account, the manager faces personal regulatory exposure under FINRA (Series 24 license) and the forecast tampering allegation becomes potentially the most dangerous element in the case. **The employee's team is holding this for their attorney. Determine what the logs show before anyone else pulls them. Do not modify any CRM records.**

0b. **Pull Sabrina Sparapani's HR exit interview notes from approximately July 2025.** She told the plaintiff she was "veeeerrrry honest" about the manager in her exit interview. If those notes contain specific complaints about leave-based retaliation, Bloomberg had institutional notice of the alleged conduct. If the notes are generic, the institutional knowledge argument is substantially weaker. The actual content is unknown -- determine what was documented.

### Priority 1: Litigation Hold (Do Within 24 Hours)

1. **Issue a litigation hold notice to all custodians identified in Section 3.2** (updated to include Santore and CRM/Sales Operations Administrator). Include IT, HR, the manager, Santore, and records custodians. The notice should specify: do not delete, modify, or destroy any documents relating to Aleksandr Akulov, his team, coverage assignments, performance evaluations, compensation decisions, parental leave, Sam Page, Sabrina Sparapani, or CRM forecast records. Suspend all auto-deletion routines for the identified systems and date ranges.

2. **Confirm that Sam Page's employment records are intact and preserved.** If any records have been destroyed pursuant to routine retention, document when and why. This must be verified within 24 hours.

3. **Confirm that Sabrina Sparapani's employment records -- including HR exit interview notes -- are intact and preserved.** Same urgency. The exit interview notes are a specific priority.

### Priority 2: Retain External Employment Counsel AND Personal Counsel for Manager (CRITICAL -- Employee Already Has Interested Counsel) *(Updated Feb 23)*

4. **Engage experienced employment defense counsel for Bloomberg immediately.** Phillips & Associates has conducted a 50-minute substantive consultation and wants to represent the employee at 40% contingency. Outten & Golden has also been contacted. Attorney retention by the employee is imminent -- days, not weeks. Bloomberg's defense counsel must be retained NOW.

4a. *(Updated Feb 23)* **The manager MUST retain personal employment counsel, separate from Bloomberg's defense team.** The need for personal counsel has intensified. In addition to the forecast tampering allegation, the national origin discrimination claims ("Comrade" and "Rahul") are attributed to the manager's personal conduct -- not management decisions Bloomberg can defend as business judgment. Bloomberg may distance itself from this behavior specifically. Under NYCHRL, the manager can be held personally liable as an "aider and abettor" of discriminatory conduct. The manager needs independent counsel to advise on: (a) the FINRA implications of the forecast allegation, (b) individual liability exposure for national origin discrimination, (c) personal exposure for the "Comrade"/"Rahul" conduct that Bloomberg may not defend, and (d) what to do if Bloomberg's interests and his interests diverge.

5. **Brief defense counsel on the full case file.** Provide counsel with this document, the VULNERABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md, the DEFENSE_STRATEGY.md, and all underlying evidence referenced herein. Counsel needs to assess the company's actual exposure with access to Bloomberg's internal data, not just the employee's characterization.

### Priority 3: Internal Investigation (Begin Within One Week) *(Updated Feb 21)*

6. **Conduct a privileged internal investigation under counsel's direction.** The investigation must answer the following questions definitively:
   - What was the employee's coverage universe before his first leave, after his first return, and after his second return? When and why did each change occur?
   - Was the 52% revenue target increase unique to the employee or team-wide?
   - What did Sam Page's PIP and separation look like? Was it well-documented? Was it leave-proximate?
   - Did the manager ever express leave-related frustration to anyone in writing?
   - Were any complaints filed about the manager related to leave, family status, or gender?
   - Did HR review the 2025 evaluations before they were delivered? Did anyone flag the leave references?
   - How many other team members received 0% raises in February 2025 and February 2026?
   - Who else took extended (4+ month) parental leave under this manager, and what were their outcomes?
   - *(Added Feb 21)* What does the CRM audit trail show for 9/5/2025? (Should be answered by Priority 0a above, but must be formally documented under counsel's supervision.)
   - *(Added Feb 21)* What did Sabrina Sparapani tell HR in her exit interview? What was documented? (Should be answered by Priority 0b above.)
   - *(Added Feb 21)* What was Santore's role in reviewing the employee's evaluations? Did Sabrina's exit interview complaints reach Santore or any other person in the chain of command?
   - *(Added Feb 21)* Does Bloomberg have any standard procedures for how managers handle CRM forecast records when employees are on leave?
   - *(Added Feb 23)* Did the manager use the term "Comrade" to address the employee? How frequently? Who witnessed it? When and why did the manager stop?
   - *(Added Feb 23)* Did the manager call Bryan Baptist "Rahul"? How frequently? Were any complaints filed?
   - *(Added Feb 23)* What anti-harassment training has the manager completed? Does it cover national origin discrimination or ethnic stereotyping?
   - *(Added Feb 23)* Review Bryan Baptist's employment file -- evaluations, coverage assignments, departure documentation, and coverage redistribution records.

7. **Pull comparative data immediately:**
   - Revenue targets for all team members (2025, 2026)
   - Coverage universe assignments over time (2018-present) for all team members
   - Performance evaluations for all team members (2023-2026)
   - Compensation outcomes for all team members (Feb 2025, Feb 2026)
   - All employees who took 4+ months of leave under this manager (complete list)

### Priority 4: Manager Coaching (Begin After Counsel Retained)

8. **All coaching of the manager must be done through and at the direction of defense counsel.** Do not attempt to "prepare" the manager informally. Any informal conversations about how to characterize events become discoverable if revealed.

9. **Instruct the manager immediately (through counsel) on the following non-negotiable rules:**
   - Do not reference parental leave in any future communication with the employee, verbal or written.
   - Do not discuss the employee's situation with other team members.
   - Do not contact Sam Page, Sabrina Sparapani, or any former employee.
   - Do not modify, delete, or alter any document -- **especially CRM records**.
   - Do not have any off-the-record conversations with the employee about leave, compensation, or performance that are not also documented.
   - Every interaction with the employee should be professional, documented, and defensible.
   - *(Added Feb 23)* Do not use any informal names, nicknames, ethnic references, or culturally-coded greetings with ANY team member. "Comrade," "Rahul," or any similar term must never be used again.
   - *(Added Feb 23)* Prepare a single, consistent explanation for the "Comrade" usage before any formal proceeding. Do not improvise under oath.

### Priority 5: Documentation Audit (Complete Within Two Weeks)

10. **Audit the paper trail for the employee's performance management.** Identify every piece of written feedback, email, evaluation comment, or documented concern about his performance. Determine whether the documented concerns pre-date his first leave or emerge only afterward. The temporal analysis is critical: if all documented performance concerns post-date the first leave, the pretext argument is extremely strong.

11. **Audit the evaluation process.** Determine who reviewed the 2025 evaluations before they were delivered, whether anyone raised concerns, and whether Bloomberg has written guidance on evaluating employees who were on leave for part of the evaluation period.

12. **Identify any employee under the manager's supervision who took 4+ months of parental leave and did NOT experience adverse consequences.** Even one such employee provides a defense comparator. If none exist, this must be acknowledged and planned for.

### Priority 6: Proactive Measures (Discuss with Counsel)

13. **Assess whether to restore some coverage to the employee.** This is a strategic decision that must be made with counsel. Restoring coverage could be framed as responsive management adjusting to a reasonable employee request. It also moots one of the strongest allegations. However, if timed poorly (after a complaint is filed), it looks like consciousness of guilt.

14. **Assess whether the 2026 revenue target should be adjusted.** If the target increase was disproportionate, adjusting it now -- with documented business rationale (e.g., recalibration based on team-wide coverage rebalancing) -- is better than defending it later. If the increase was team-wide, document that immediately.

15. **Assess whether a PIP should be deferred.** Implementing a PIP within the next three months, against an employee who was evaluated using leave-impacted data, with the smallest coverage on the team and a 52% target increase, will look retaliatory to any jury, judge, or mediator regardless of how well the PIP is designed. Counsel should advise on the timing calculus: is the benefit of formal performance management worth the litigation risk of confirming the employee's predicted playbook?

16. **Prepare for the employee's follow-up meeting (~March 5-10).** The employee has scheduled a meeting with his manager. This meeting is an evidence-generation opportunity for both sides. The manager must be prepared (through counsel) to handle this meeting in a way that is documented, professional, and does not create additional admissions. If the employee raises coverage or targets, the response must be prepared in advance.

17. **(Added Feb 24)** Coach Platt immediately on Bloomberg MSG usage. He is generating live, timestamped evidence in Bloomberg's enterprise systems. Every exchange questioning Sasha's assignments or framing successes as gaps is being screenshot and forwarded to the support team (and soon to an attorney) within hours.

18. **(Added Feb 24)** Identify Tommy. Who is he? Was he ever assigned to Clear Street? Is he the same person who received the CT lead reassignment? His identity and role in account assignments is now directly relevant.

19. **(Added Feb 24)** Determine Bloomberg's policy on mid-year reviews during employee leave. Is in-person required? Were remote reviews ever conducted for other leave-taking employees? If there's no policy and the in-person requirement was discretionary, prepare an explanation.

20. **(Added Feb 24)** Pull Platt's MSG history with all team members. Compare the frequency and tone of account-assignment questions to Sasha vs. other team members. If the pattern is asymmetric, prepare for the comparator argument.

21. **(Added Feb 24)** Preserve the Feb 24 Clear Street MSG exchanges in the litigation hold. These are now primary evidence.

## Appendix: Intelligence on Opponent's Known Gaps *(Added Feb 21 evening)*

The employee's case file includes two documents that reveal their known weaknesses: `FACTS.md` (267 numbered facts, many marked as unconfirmed or pending verification) and `Questions_for_Sasha.md` (77 detailed questions they need answered). Key gaps in their knowledge that the defense should exploit:

1. **Pre-leave coverage baseline.** They do not have confirmed data on Sasha's coverage universe before his first leave. If his coverage was already smaller than peers' pre-leave, the "leave caused the stripping" narrative weakens significantly. They explicitly flag this as a gap.

2. **Sam Page details.** They have secondhand characterizations but no specifics: no PIP dates, no evaluation content, no separation terms, no contact information for Page. Their entire pattern theory rests on Sasha's recollection of a former colleague's experience.

3. **Target-setting methodology.** They do not know whether the 52% target increase was team-wide or individual. They've identified this as a critical question. If the increase was team-wide, their "setup to fail" argument on targets collapses.

4. **Johnston's leave decisions.** They speculate that Johnston felt pressure to take short leave, but have no evidence. Their comparator analysis assumes Johnston's short leave was coerced; if Johnston chose it freely for personal reasons, the comparison changes.

5. **GDSF forecast counting methodology.** They have the CRM IDs but do not know Bloomberg's internal definition of "booked forecast" vs. earlier-stage pipeline entries. If the "1 forecast" language reflects a consistent team-wide methodology, their "omission" claim is weakened.

6. **Anthony's identity.** They only know his first name. If the defense identifies him first and he is a favorable witness, this is a minor advantage.

7. **Sabrina's formal cooperation.** They do not know whether Sabrina will actually cooperate with an attorney. They are treating her iMessage statements as if she will testify, but the gap between texting a friend and sitting for a deposition is real.

8. **Exact timeline of coverage changes.** They have approximate dates for when territories were stripped but not precise dates from Bloomberg's systems. The precise dates matter for establishing temporal proximity to leave.

9. *(Added Feb 23)* **"Comrade" witness corroboration.** They know Emily, JJ, and Sabrina witnessed the "Comrade" usage, but have not confirmed whether any of them would testify to it. Sabrina is likely cooperative; the others are unknown. If Emily and JJ would deny or not recall, the allegation weakens to Sasha's word only.

10. *(Added Feb 23)* **Bryan Baptist's cooperation.** They know Baptist was called "Rahul" and was annoyed, but have not contacted him. His willingness to cooperate is unknown. He left Bloomberg -- if he left on good terms, he may not want to get involved. If he left on bad terms, he may be eager to cooperate.

**How to use this:** Focus the internal investigation on the areas where the defense has information the employee does not. If the data in those areas supports the defense (pre-leave coverage was already low, target increase was team-wide, Sam Page's file is clean), the defense posture improves significantly. If the data is bad, at least the defense knows before the employee's attorney discovers it.
